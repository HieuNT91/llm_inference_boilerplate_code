Therefore, the total demand during the lead time is:\n\n\\[ 1500 \\text{ phones/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 4500 \\text{ phones} \\]\n\nAdding the safety stock of 500 phones, the total number of cell phones needed is:\n\n\\[ 4500 \\text{ phones} + 500 \\text{ phones} = 5000 \\text{ phones} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of cell phones Marlo Stanfield has in stock at the beginning of each week. They have a lot size of 350 cell phones each time they restock. Since they restock every week, the number of cell phones in stock at the beginning of each week is 350.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many weeks out of every 52 weeks they will have enough cell phones to meet the demand without running out. This is the fill rate. The fill rate is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{ Fill rate} = \\frac{\\text{Number of weeks they have enough cell phones}}{\\text{Total number of weeks}} = \\frac{350 \\text{ phones}}{5000 \\text{ phones}} = \\frac{350}{5000} = \\frac{7}{100} = 0.07 \\]\n\nTo express the fill rate as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n\\[ 0.07 \\times 100 = 7\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the fill rate under this policy is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7\\%} \\]",
            "To determine the fill rate under Marlo Stanfield's policy, we need to calculate the total number of cells required during the lead time and add the safety stock, then compare it to the actual demand over that period.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cells required during the lead time plus the safety stock:\n1. The lead time is 3 weeks, and the average weekly demand is 1500 phones. So, the number of phones needed during the lead time is:\n\\[ 1500 \\times 3 = 4500 \\text{ phones} \\]\n2. Adding the safety stock of 500 phones, the total number of phones needed is:\n\\[ 4500 + 500 = 5000 \\text{ phones} \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the actual demand over the lead time. Since the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 1500 and a standard deviation of 145, the total demand over 3 weeks will also be normally distributed with a mean of:\n\\[ 1500 \\times 3 = 4500 \\text{ phones} \\]\nand a standard deviation of:\n\\[ 145 \\times \\sqrt{3} \\approx 251.66 \\text{ phones} \\]\n\nThe fill rate is the probability that the actual demand will not exceed the planned demand (5000 phones). We need to find the probability that the actual demand is less than or equal to 5000 phones.\n\nLet \\( X \\) be the total demand over 3 weeks. \\( X \\) is normally distributed with a mean of 4500 and a standard deviation of 251.66. We want to find \\( P(X \\leq 5000) \\).\n\nFirst, we convert 5000 to a z-score:\n\\[ z = \\frac{5000 - 4500}{251.66} \\approx 1.99 \\]\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table, the probability corresponding to \\( z = 1.99 \\) is approximately 0.9767. This means that the fill rate is about 97.67%.\n\nSo, the fill rate under this policy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.9767} \\]",
            "To determine the fill rate under Marlo Stanfield's policy, we need to calculate the total number of cell phones required during the lead time and add the safety stock to find the total finished goods needed.

Calculate the average number of cell phones used during the lead time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average usage during lead time} = \\text{Average weekly usage} \\times \\text{ lead time} = 1500 \\times 3 = 4500\n   \\]\n\n2.

This suggests that the policy is not feasible under the given conditions. But if we strictly follow the given policy, the fill rate is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.11}\n\\]",

            "To determine the average inventory carried by B&M Office Supplies, we need to consider both the on-hand inventory and the inventory on order. The store manager orders 10,000 phones when the inventory on hand drops to 6,000. This means that the average inventory on hand is the average of the initial inventory and the final inventory, which is 6,000. The inventory on order is a continuous review policy, and the average inventory on order is the lead time (2 weeks) times the average demand during that lead time.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the average inventory on order. The average demand per week is 2,500, so the average demand during the lead time of 2 weeks is:\n\\[ 2,500 \\times 2 = 5,000 \\]\n\nSince the store manager orders 10,000 phones, the inventory on order will be 5,000 on average (since the order will be received after 2 weeks).\n\nNow, we can calculate the average inventory carried by B&M by adding the average inventory on hand and the average inventory on order:\n\\[ 6,000 + 5,000 = 11,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the average inventory carried by B&M is:\n\\[ \\boxed{11000} \\]",

The safety stock is the amount of inventory needed to cover the demand during the lead time plus a certain amount of extra inventory to guard against variability in demand. Typically, the safety stock is calculated as a multiple of the standard deviation of the demand during the lead time. For this problem, we will assume a common value of 3 standard deviations for the safety stock, which is a standard practice in inventory management.\n\nThe standard deviation of the demand during the lead time is:\n\\[ \\text{Standard deviation of demand during lead time} = \\sqrt{2} \\times \\text{standard deviation of weekly demand} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 500 \\approx 707.11. \\]\n\nThe safety stock is:\n\\[ \\text{Safety stock} = 3 \\times \\text{standard deviation of demand during lead time} = 3 \\times 707.11 \\approx 2121.32. \\]\n\nThe total inventory on the shelf when the manager places an order is the safety stock. Therefore, the inventory on the shelf when the manager places an order is approximately 2121.32 units. Since the manager orders 10,000 units, the on-hand inventory when the order is received is:\n\\[ \\text{On-hand inventory} = 10000 - 6000 + 2121.32 = 6121.32. \\]\n\nThe average inventory carried by B&M is the average of the on-hand inventory and the inventory on the shelf:\n\\[ \\text{Average inventory} = \\frac{\\text{On-hand inventory} + \\text{ inventory on the shelf}}{2} = \\frac{6121.32 + 2121.32}{2} = \\frac{8242.64}{2} = 4121.32. \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the average inventory carried by B&M is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4121}. \\]",

Since the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 2,500, the lead time demand is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ lead time demand} = 2 \\times 2500 = 5000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is the additional inventory kept to account for variability in demand during the lead time. For a normal distribution, a common approach is to use the standard deviation of the lead time demand. The standard deviation of the lead time demand is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{standard deviation of lead time demand} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 500 = 500 \\times 1.414 = 707\n   \\]\n   To find the safety stock, we typically use a z-score that corresponds to a desired service level.

Since the weekly demand for phones is normally distributed with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 500, the lead time demand (which is the demand over 2 weeks) will also be normally distributed with a mean of \\(2 \\times 2500 = 5000\\) and a standard deviation of \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times 500 \\approx 707.11\\).\n\nThe store manager orders 10,000 phones when the inventory on hand drops to 6,000. This means that the store starts with 10,000 phones and orders more only when the inventory drops to 6,000.

The lead time is 2 weeks, and the lead time lead speed is the average demand during the lead time, which is the mean demand multiplied by the lead time. The mean demand is 2,500 phones per week, so the lead time lead speed is:\n\n\\[ \\text{lead time lead speed} = 2,500 \\times 2 = 5,000 \\text{ phones} \\]\n\nThe lead time demand is the demand during the lead time, which is the same as the lead time lead speed, 5,000 phones.

This means the re-order point is 6,000 + 10,000 = 16,000 phones.\n\n3. **Calculate the lead time demand:**\n   The lead time is 2 weeks. The lead time demand is the expected demand over 2 weeks, which is \\(2 \\times 2,500 = 5,000\\) phones.\n\n4. **Determine the service level:**\n   The service level is the probability that the demand during the lead time is less than or equal to the re-order point. Since the lead time demand is normally distributed with a mean of 5,000 and a standard deviation of \\(2 \\times 500 = 1,000\\) (because the standard deviation scales with the square root of time), we can use the standard normal distribution to find the service level.\n   \n   The z-score for the re-order point is:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{16,000 - 5,000}{1,000} = 11\n   \\]\n   However, a z-score of 11 is extremely high and practically means the store will always have enough stock to meet the re-order point. In practice, we can assume the service level is 100% for such a high z-score.\n\n5. **Calculate the average inventory:**\n   The average inventory is the sum of the on-hand inventory and the on-order inventory. The on-hand inventory is the average of the inventory on hand and the inventory on order.

The remaining inventory on hand is 6,000, and the safety stock is the amount that ensures the inventory level after the lead time demand is 6,000. Therefore, the safety stock is 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000.\n   - The safety stock is 4,000, which is also the amount of demand during the lead time that is covered by the remaining inventory on hand and the safety stock.

            "To evaluate the average time a phone spends at B&M, we need to determine the average time a phone is out of stock and the average time a phone is in stock. The total average time a phone spends at B&M is the sum of these two times.\n\nFirst, let's determine the probability that the inventory on hand drops to 6,000 or less. This is equivalent to finding the probability that the weekly demand for phones is at least 4,000 (since the inventory drops to 6,000 when the demand is 4,000).\n\nThe weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 500. We need to standardize the value 4,000 to a z-score:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{4000 - 2500}{500} = \\frac{1500}{500} = 3\n\\]\nThe probability that the weekly demand is at least 4,000 is the same as the probability that the z-score is at least 3. From standard normal distribution tables, we find that the probability that a z-score is less than 3 is approximately 0.9987. Therefore, the probability that the z-score is at least 3 is:\n\\[\nP(Z \\geq 3) = 1 - P(Z < 3) = 1 - 0.9987 = 0.0013\n\\]\nThis means that about 0.13% of the time, the inventory will drop to 6,000 or less. Since the manufacturer takes 2 weeks to fill an order, the average time a phone spends out of stock is 2 weeks.\n\nNext, we need to determine the average time a phone spends in stock. The store manager orders 10,000 phones when the inventory on hand drops to 6,000. The average time a phone spends in stock is the time it takes to use up the inventory of 4,000 phones. The average time to use up 4,000 phones is the lead time plus the average time the phone spends in stock during the lead time.\n\nThe lead time is 2 weeks, which is equivalent to 10 days (assuming 5 working days per week). The average time a phone spends in stock during the lead time is the lead time divided by the number of phones ordered per day. The number of phones ordered per day is:\n\\[\n\\frac{10000}{7 \\text{ days}} \\approx 1428.57 \\text{ phones per day}\n\\]\nThe average time a phone spends in stock during the lead time is:\n\\[\n\\frac{10 \\text{ days}}{1428.57 \\text{ phones per day}} \\approx 0.007 \\text{ days}\n\\]\nTo convert this to weeks, we divide by 7:\n\\[\n0.007 \\text{ days} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ week}}{7 \\text{ days}} \\approx 0.001 \\text{ weeks}\n\\]\nTherefore, the average time a phone spends in stock is:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ weeks} + 0.001 \\text{ weeks} \\approx 2 \\text{ weeks}\n\\]\nThe total average time a phone spends at B&M is the sum of the average time a phone spends out of stock and the average time a phone spends in stock:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ weeks} + 2 \\text{ weeks} = 4 \\text{ weeks}\n\\]\nThus, the average time a phone spends at B&M is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
            "To evaluate the average time a phone spends at B&M, we need to determine the average lead time and the average time a phone spends in the system (including lead time and cycle time).\n\nFirst, let's determine the lead time. The manufacturer takes 2 weeks to fill an order, so the lead time is 2 weeks.\n\nNext, we need to determine the average cycle time. The store manager orders 10,000 phones when the inventory on hand drops to 6,000. This means the store needs to restock 4,000 phones before placing an order. Since the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 500, we need to find the time it takes to restock 4,000 phones.\n\nThe average restock time is the time it takes to sell 4,000 phones at a rate of 2,500 phones per week. This is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Restock time} = \\frac{4000}{2500} = 1.6 \\text{ weeks}\n\\]\nThe average cycle time is the sum of the lead time and the restock time:\n\\[\n\\text{Average cycle time} = 2 + 1.6 = 3.6 \\text{ weeks}\n\\]\nThe average time a phone spends at B&M is the average cycle time, which is 3.6 weeks.\n\nTherefore, the average time a phone spends at B&M is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3.6}\n\\]",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the lead time:**\n   The lead time is the time it takes for the manufacturer to fill an order. According to the problem, the manufacturer takes 2 weeks to fill an order. So, the lead time is 2 weeks.\n\n2. **Determine the average time a phone spends in inventory:**\n   The store manager orders 10,000 phones when the inventory drops to 6,000. This means that the store starts with 6,000 phones in inventory when it places a new order. The demand for phones is normally distributed with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 500. The store manager orders 10,000 phones when the inventory drops to 6,000, which means that the store needs to have enough inventory to cover the demand for 2,500 phones (the lead time demand) plus the average demand during the lead time plus the average time a phone spends in inventory.\n\n   Let's denote the average time a phone spends in inventory before being sold as \\( T \\). The total inventory at the time of placing the order should be the sum of the lead time demand, the average demand during the lead time, and the average time a phone spends in inventory. This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   6000 = 2500 + 2500 + T \\cdot 500\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   6000 = 5000 + 500T\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1000 = 500T\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   T = 2\n   \\]\n   So, the average time a phone spends in inventory before being sold is 2 weeks.\n\n3. **Calculate the average time a phone spends at B&M:**\n   The average time a phone spends at B&M is the sum of the lead time and the average time a phone spends in inventory. Therefore, the average time a phone spends at B&M is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ weeks} + 2 \\text{ weeks} = 4 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the average time a phone spends at B&M is \\(\\boxed{4}\\) weeks."

            "To determine the safety inventory that the Guac Shop should carry, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the lead time and the desired service level.\n2. Calculate the safety stock using the formula: \\( \\text{ safety stock} = Z \\times \\sigma \\), where \\( Z \\) is the Z-score corresponding to the desired service level, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of the demand during the lead time.\n3. Calculate the lead time demand, which is the mean demand during the lead time.\n4. Add the safety stock to the lead time demand to get the total safety inventory.\n\nLet's go through these steps in detail:\n\n1. **Identify the lead time and the desired service level:**\n   - The lead time is 2 weeks.\n   - The desired service level is 97.5%, which corresponds to a Z-score of 1.96 (from standard normal distribution tables).\n\n2. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   - The standard deviation of the demand during the lead time is the standard deviation of weekly demand multiplied by the square root of the lead time.\n   - The standard deviation of weekly demand is 650.\n   - Therefore, the standard deviation of the demand during the lead time is \\( 650 \\times \\sqrt{2} = 650 \\times 1.414 = 920.1 \\).\n   - The safety stock is \\( 1.96 \\times 920.1 = 1803.196 \\approx 1803 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the lead time demand:**\n   - The lead time demand is the mean demand during the lead time, which is 2500.\n\n4. **Calculate the total safety inventory:**\n   - The total safety inventory is the sum of the lead time demand and the safety stock.\n   - Therefore, the total safety inventory is \\( 2500 + 1803 = 4303 \\).\n\nThe safety inventory that the Guac Shop should carry is \\(\\boxed{4303}\\).",
