Since 80 deliveries are taken by the companies, the remaining capacity for individuals is:\n   \\[\n   110 - 80 = 30\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the numerical center can accommodate 30 individuals each day.\n\n4. **Consider the demand for individuals:**\n   Since the numerical center can only handle 30 individuals and the demand for individuals is often turned away due to lack of capacity, the number of individuals that should be admitted each day is the maximum number of individuals that can be handled, which is 30.\n\nThus, the number of individuals that should be admitted each day is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
            "To determine how many individuals should be admitted each day, we need to analyze the demand and capacity constraints of the numerical center.\n\n1. **Identify the total number of deliveries:**\n   The numerical center can handle 110 deliveries in a day.\n\n2. **Determine the number of companies and their tips:**\n   On average, 80 companies tip their trucks each day, with a standard deviation of 15. However, the exact number of deliveries from companies is not directly given, but we know the total capacity.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of individual deliveries:**\n   Let \\( x \\) be the number of individuals admitted each day. Since the numerical center can handle a total of 110 deliveries, the number of individual deliveries must be such that the total number of deliveries ( companies + individuals) does not exceed 110. Since the exact number of company deliveries is not specified, we assume the worst-case scenario where all deliveries are from companies (which is the maximum possible number of deliveries from companies, 80).\n\n   Therefore, the number of individual deliveries \\( x \\) must be such that:\n   \\[\n   80 + x \\leq 110\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x \\leq 110 - 80\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x \\leq 30\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The numerical center can handle up to 30 individuals each day without exceeding its capacity of 110 deliveries.

Customer demand for the beams is 5 tons per week. To produce I-beams, the mill must go through a setup that requires changing to the appropriate rolling patterns. Each setup costs the mill \\$10,000 in labor and lost production. I-beams cost the mill \\$2,000 per ton and the mill has an annual holding cost of 25 percent.

The EOQ model helps us find the optimal production quantity that minimizes the total cost, which includes setup costs and holding costs.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- \\( D \\) = Annual demand for I-beams = 5 tons/week * 52 weeks/year = 260 tons/year\n- \\( C \\) = Cost per ton of I-beams = \\$2,000\n- \\( h \\) = Annual holding cost rate = 25% = 0.25\n- \\( S \\) = Setup cost per setup = \\$10,000\n\nThe formula for the economic order quantity (EOQ) is:\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2DC}{hC}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 260 \\times 2000}{0.25 \\times 2000}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1040000}{500}} = \\sqrt{2080} \\approx 45.61 \\]\n\nSince the production rate is 20 tons per week, the mill needs to produce 20 tons per week to meet the demand. To find out how many weeks it takes to produce the optimal quantity, we divide the optimal quantity by the production rate:\n\\[ \\text{Number of weeks} = \\frac{45.61}{20} \\approx 2.28 \\]\n\nThis means the mill needs to produce approximately 2.28 weeks worth of I-beams each week to maintain a stable inventory level.

So, \\(X \\sim N(40 - 40, 5^2) = N(0, 25)\\).\n   - We need to find \\(P(X < 45)\\), which is \\(P\\left(Z < \\frac{45 - 40}{5}\\right) = P(Z < 1)\\), where \\(Z\\) is a standard normal variable.\n   - From the standard normal distribution table, \\(P(Z < 1) \\approx 0.8413\\).\n   - Therefore, the probability of a stockout is \\(1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the expected cost of a stockout per day:**\n   - The cost of a stockout is the cost of the bottles needed to meet the demand that cannot be met. Since the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 40 and a standard deviation of 5, the expected number of bottles needed to meet the demand that cannot be met is the expected value of the exceedance over 45, which is \\(E[(X - 45)^+]\\).\n   - For a normal distribution \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), the expected value of the exceedance over a threshold \\(a\\) is given by \\(\\sigma \\phi\\left(\\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is the standard normal density function.\n   - Here, \\(a = 45\\), \\(\\mu = 40\\), and \\(\\sigma = 5\\). So, \\(E[(X - 45)^+ = 5 \\phi\\left(\\frac{45 - 40}{5}\\right) = 5 \\phi(1)\\).\n   - From the standard normal distribution table, \\(\\phi(1) \\approx 0.24196\\). Therefore, \\(E[(X - 45)^+ = 5 \\times 0.24196 = 1.2098\\).\n   - The cost of a stockout is \\$4 per bottle, so the expected cost of a stockout per day is \\(1.2098 \\times 4 = 4.8392\\).\n\n5. **Annualize the expected cost of a stockout:**\n   - The annual cost of a stockout is \\(4.8392 \\times 365 = 1764.992\\).\n\nTherefore, the cost of stocking out that justifies the current policy is \\(\\boxed{1765}\\).",

However, we need to consider the cost of back orders if there were any.\n\n5. **Calculate the annual holding cost:**\n   The annual holding cost is the holding cost per bottle multiplied by the average inventory level.\n   \\[\n   \\text{average inventory level} = \\frac{\\text{total inventory level}}{2} = \\frac{85 \\text{ bottles}}{2} = 42.5 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{annual holding cost} = 42.5 \\text{ bottles} \\times \\$4/\\text{bottle} \\times 0.25 = \\$42.50\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the cost of back orders:**\n   Since the current policy does not result in any back orders, the cost of back orders is zero.\n\n7. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   The total cost is the sum of the annual holding cost and the cost of back orders.\n   \\[\n   \\text{total cost} = \\$42.50 + \\$0 = \\$42.50\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of stocking out justifies the current policy is \\(\\boxed{42.5}\\).",

Therefore, the expected cost of the space needed is:\n\\[ 300,000 \\text{ square feet} \\times \u20ac9.00/\\text{square foot} = \u20ac2,700,000. \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of purchasing storage space on the spot market. The spot market rate is \u20ac0.90 per square foot per month, so the annual cost is \u20ac0.90 \\times 12 = \u20ac10.80 per square foot.\n\nThe expected cost of purchasing storage space on the spot market is the space needed multiplied by the annual cost per square foot. Therefore, the expected cost of purchasing storage space on the spot market is:\n\\[ 300,000 \\text{ square feet} \\times \u20ac10.80/\\text{square foot} = \u20ac3,240,000. \\]\n\nComparing the two costs, the cost of the full-year least is \u20ac2,700,000, and the cost of purchasing storage space on the spot market is \u20ac3,240,000. Since \u20ac2,700,000 is less than \u20ac3,240,000, the manager should sign a full-year contract at \u20ac0.75 per square foot per month.\n\nTherefore, the manager should sign a full-year contract. The size of the contract should be the mean space needed, which is 300,000 square feet.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{300000}\n\\]",

However, the manager must also consider the probability that the actual need will exceed the contract size. The manager should sign a contract that covers the expected need plus a sufficient amount to cover the standard deviation with a high probability.\n\nGiven that the need is normally distributed with a mean of 300,000 square feet and a standard deviation of 125,000 square feet, the manager should sign a contract that covers the mean plus one standard deviation to cover 68% of the time (one standard deviation covers about 68% of the distribution). Therefore, the contract size should be:\n\\[ 300,000 + 125,000 = 425,000 \\text{ square feet} \\]\n\nThus, the manager should sign an annual contract for \\(\\boxed{425000}\\) square feet.",

The safety stock is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ safety stock} = \\mu_{\\text{ lead time}} + z \\times \\sigma_{\\text{total demand}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(z\\) is the z-score corresponding to the desired service level. The inventory level when the manager places an order is 600 bananas, and the initial inventory is 1000 bananas. Therefore, the safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   1000 - 600 = 400 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   So,\n   \\[\n   400 = 600 + z \\times 86.60\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(z\\):\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{400 - 600}{86.60} = \\frac{-200}{86.60} \\approx -2.31\n   \\]\n   Since the z-score cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the safety stock calculation.

If the total demand exceeds the critical inventory level, the stand will lose sales. Here, the total demand (600 bananas) is exactly equal to the critical inventory level (600 bananas), so there are no lost sales during this period.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total lost sales cost} = 0 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total cost of holding and lost sales:**\n   The total cost is the sum of the holding cost and the lost sales cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 360 + 0 = 360 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total revenue from the bananas sold during the lead time:**\n   The total revenue from the bananas sold during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   600 \\times 0.50 = 300 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the profit:**\n   The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = 300 - 360 = -60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nSince the stand loses all demand during the lead time, the customer service level is 0%.

Since the numerical field can handle 110 deliveries in a day, and the average number of deliveries from companies is 80, we should enter up to 110 deliveries in total.\n\n   If all 110 deliveries are from companies, then the number of company dump trucks should be equal to the number of deliveries minus the number of deliveries from individuals. Since the problem does not specify the number of individuals, we can assume that the rest of the deliveries are from companies, and thus the number of company dump trucks should be equal to the number of deliveries minus the number of deliveries from individuals.\n\n   Therefore, the number of company dump trucks that should be admitted each day is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{110}\n   \\]",
            "To determine how many company dump trucks should be admitted each day, we need to consider the capacity constraints and the demand for both companies and individuals. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of deliveries possible in a day:**\n   The field can handle 110 deliveries in a day.\n\n2. **Determine the average number of company dump trucks entering the\u573a each day:**\n   On average, 80 companies tip their trucks each day. However, since the field can only handle 110 deliveries, the maximum number of company dump trucks that can enter the field each day is 110.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of individual deliveries:**\n   Since the total number of deliveries is limited to 110, and the maximum number of company dump trucks is 110, there are no individual deliveries entering the field. This means all 110 deliveries are company dump trucks.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The number of company dump trucks that should be admitted each day is 110.\n\nTherefore, the number of company dump trucks that should be admitted each day is \\(\\boxed{110}\\)."

However, we need to verify if this batch size is practical and meets the customer demand. The mill needs to produce enough I-beams to meet the annual demand of 1040 tons.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost Before the Price Reduction\n1. ** demand per week**: 500 boxes\n2. ** holding cost rate**: 30% of the cost price\n3. **fixed cost per order**: \\$100\n4. **cost price per box before promotion**: \\$2\n\nFirst, calculate the holding cost per box:\n\\[ \\text{ hold\\_cost\\_per\\_box} = 0.30 \\times 2 = 0.60 \\]\n\nNext, calculate the total cost per box including the holding cost:\n\\[ \\text{total\\_cost\\_per\\_box} = 2 + 0.60 = 2.60 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the total annual cost for ordering 500 boxes per week:\n\\[ \\text{annual\\_ orders} = 500 \\times 4 = 2000 \\text{ orders} \\]\n\\[ \\text{total\\_annual\\_cost} = 2000 \\times 100 + 2000 \\times 2.60 = 200000 + 5200 = 205200 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Cost After the Price Reduction\n1. **new cost price per box after promotion**: \\$1.80\n\nCalculate the new holding cost per box:\n\\[ \\text{new\\_hold\\_cost\\_per\\_box} = 0.30 \\times 1.80 = 0.54 \\]\n\nNext, calculate the new total cost per box including the holding cost:\n\\[ \\text{new\\_total\\_cost\\_per\\_box} = 1.80 + 0.54 = 2.34 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the total annual cost for ordering 500 boxes per week:\n\\[ \\text{annual\\_ orders} = 500 \\times 4 = 2000 \\text{ orders} \\]\n\\[ \\text{total\\_annual\\_cost} = 2000 \\times 100 + 2000 \\times 2.34 = 200000 + 4680 = 204680 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Total Costs\n- Total cost before promotion: \\$205,200\n- Total cost after promotion: \\$204,680\n\nSince the total cost after the price reduction is lower, Tastee Mart should order at the reduced price.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{500 \\text{ boxes per week}}"
