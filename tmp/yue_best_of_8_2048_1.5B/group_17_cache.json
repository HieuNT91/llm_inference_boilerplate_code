One cruise line that routinely docks at the port is considering a plan to maintain their own donkey herd, which will cost them \\$15,000 per thousand tourists. The number of tourists needing this service is normally distributed, with a mean of 10,000 and a standard deviation of 3,000. Usually, this is enough donkey capacity, but occasionally the cruise line rotates a bigger ship through this route and the excursion director must purchase donkey capacity on the spot market, where is costs \\$20 per tourist. Once a local donkey herder learns of the cruise line's plan, he lowers his donkey rental price to \\$17.50 per tourist. How many donkeys should be in the cruise line's herd?\nassistant\n",

We can do this by calculating the expected cost for different values of \\( N \\) and choosing the one that gives the lowest cost.\n\nLet's calculate the expected cost for \\( N = 10,000 \\):\n\\[ E(T \\mid T \\leq 10,000) = 10,000 - 3,000 \\frac{\\phi(0)}{\\Phi(0)} = 10,000 - 3,000 \\frac{0.3989}{0.5} = 10,000 - 2,393.4 = 7,606.6 \\]\n\\[ E(C) = 15 \\times 10 + 20 \\times 10,000 - 15 \\times 10 + 17.50 \\times 7,606.6 = 200,000 + 133,116.5 = 333,116.5 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected cost for \\( N = 15,000 \\):\n\\[ E(T \\mid T \\leq 15,000) = 10,000 - 3,000 \\frac{\\phi(1.6667)}{\\Phi(1.6667)} = 10,000 - 3,000 \\frac{0.1163}{0.9525} = 10,000 - 352.5 = 9,647.5 \\]\n\\[ E(C) = 15 \\times 15 + 20 \\times 10,000 - 15 \\times 15 + 17.50 \\times 9,647.5 = 225,000 + 167,661.25 = 392,661.25 \\]\n\nSince the expected cost for \\( N = 15,000 \\) is lower than for \\( N = 10,000 \\), the optimal number of donkeys in the cruise line's herd is \\(\\boxed{15000}\\).",
            "To determine the optimal number of donkeys for the cruise line's herd, we need to consider the costs and probabilities associated with the number of tourists. Let's denote the number of tourists by the random variable \\(X\\), which is normally distributed with a mean \\(\\mu = 10,000\\) and a standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 3,000\\). The probability density function for \\(X\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ P(X = x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} \\]\n\nWe need to find the optimal number of donkeys \\(N\\) that minimizes the expected cost. The expected cost consists of two parts: the cost of purchasing donkeys and the cost of purchasing tourists when there are not enough donkeys available.\n\n1. **Cost of purchasing donkeys**: If the number of tourists \\(X\\) is less than or equal to \\(N\\), the cost is \\$15,000 per thousand tourists. If \\(X > N\\), the cost is \\$20 per tourist.\n2. **Cost of purchasing tourists**: If the number of tourists \\(X\\) is less than or equal to \\(N\\), the cost is \\$0. If \\(X > N\\), the cost is \\$20 per tourist.\n\nThe expected cost \\(E(C)\\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ E(C) = \\int_{0}^{N} 15 \\times 10^3 \\times 10^3 f(x) \\, dx + \\int_{N}^{\\infty} 20 \\times 10^3 \\times 20 \\times 10^3 f(x) \\, dx \\]\n\nwhere \\(f(x)\\) is the probability density function of \\(X\\).\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\n\\[ E(C) = 15 \\times 10^6 \\int_{0}^{N} f(x) \\, dx + 400 \\times 10^6 \\int_{N}^{\\infty} f(x) \\, dx \\]\n\nSince the total probability is 1, we have:\n\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{N} f(x) \\, dx + \\int_{N}^{\\infty} f(x) \\, dx = 1 \\]\n\nLet \\(P(X \\leq N) = F(N)\\), where \\(F(N)\\) is the cumulative distribution function of \\(X\\). Then:\n\n\\[ E(C) = 15 \\times 10^6 F(N) + 400 \\times 10^6 (1 - F(N)) \\]\n\\[ E(C) = 15 \\times 10^6 F(N) + 400 \\times 10^6 - 400 \\times 10^6 F(N) \\]\n\\[ E(C) = 400 \\times 10^6 - 385 \\times 10^6 F(N) \\]\n\nTo minimize \\(E(C)\\), we need to find the value of \\(N\\) that minimizes this expression. This occurs when the derivative of \\(E(C)\\) with respect to \\(N\\) is zero. However, since \\(F(N)\\) is a monotonically increasing function, the minimum occurs when the expected number of tourists is equal to the number of donkeys purchased.\n\nThe expected number of tourists is the mean of the normal distribution, which is 10,000. Therefore, the optimal number of donkeys is:\n\n\\[ N = 10,000 \\]\n\nHowever, we need to consider the possibility of higher costs if the number of tourists exceeds the number of donkeys. To ensure we are not over-purching, we should check the cost at \\(N = 10,000\\):\n\n\\[ E(C) = 400 \\times 10^6 - 385 \\times 10^6 \\times 0.5 = 202.5 \\times 10^6 \\]\n\nThis cost is lower than the cost if we purchase donkeys for more than 10,000 tourists. Therefore, the optimal number of donkeys is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10000} \\]"

The expected number of additional donkeys needed is the expected number of tourists minus 5,000, multiplied by the cost per additional donkey:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Expected number of additional tourists} = 3000 \\times 0.9525 = 2857.5\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Expected cost of additional donkeys} = 20 \\times 2857.5 = 57150 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total expected cost is:\n     \\[\n     75000 + 57150 = 132150 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the optimal bulk price:**\n   The total cost of the 5,000 donkey herd is \\$132,150.

The souvenirs cost the professor \\$125 a box and he sells them for \\$290 a box. Souvenirs that dry out due to age can be sold for \\$80. Experience has shown that the demand for boxes of these souvenirs has a mean of 80 with a standard deviation of 20. Naturally, the professor will purchase the optimal number of boxes.

            "To determine how many friends the professor will turn away, we need to calculate the optimal number of boxes to purchase and then find out how many friends will not be able to buy a box if the professor purchases the optimal number.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- \\( C \\) is the cost per box, which is \\$125.\n- \\( S \\) is the selling price per box, which is \\$290.\n- \\( R \\) is the residue price per box, which is \\$80.\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean demand, which is 80 boxes.\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of demand, which is 20 boxes.\n\nThe expected profit per box can be calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Expected profit per box} = S - C + (R - C) \\cdot P(\\text{residue}) \\]\nwhere \\( P(\\text{residue}) \\) is the probability that a box will dry out. Since we don't have the exact probability, we can use the expected value of the profit, which simplifies to:\n\\[ \\text{Expected profit per box} = S - C + (R - C) \\cdot P(\\text{residue}) \\approx S - C + (R - C) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = S - C + \\frac{R - C}{2} = \\frac{S + R - 2C}{2} \\]\nHowever, a simpler approach is to use the critical ratio method to find the optimal order quantity. The critical ratio \\( \\text{CR} \\) is given by:\n\\[ \\text{CR} = \\frac{S - C}{S - C + R - C} = \\frac{290 - 125}{290 - 125 + 80 - 125} = \\frac{165}{120} = 1.375 \\]\nSince this critical ratio is greater than 1, we need to use the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution to find the optimal order quantity. The optimal order quantity \\( Q \\) is given by:\n\\[ Q = \\mu + z \\sigma \\]\nwhere \\( z \\) is the z-score corresponding to the critical ratio. However, since the critical ratio is greater than 1, we need to use the nearest lower value, which is 1. The z-score for a cumulative probability of 0.9999 is approximately 3.09. Therefore, the optimal order quantity is:\n\\[ Q = 80 + 3.09 \\times 20 = 141.8 \\approx 142 \\]\nSince the professor can only purchase whole boxes, he will purchase 142 boxes.\n\nIf each of his friends purchases only one box, the number of friends that will be turned away is the difference between the number of friends and the number of boxes purchased. If the number of friends is \\( F \\), then the number of friends turned away is:\n\\[ F - 142 \\]\nIf the number of friends is less than 142, then no friends will be turned away. If the number of friends is greater than 142, then the number of friends turned away is the number of friends minus 142.\n\nSince the problem does not specify the number of friends, we can only say that if the number of friends is less than 142, no friends will be turned away. If the number of friends is greater than 142, the number of friends turned away is the number of friends minus 142.\n\nTherefore, the number of friends turned away is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\nif the number of friends is less than or equal to 142.

Therefore, the professor should purchase enough boxes to meet the mean demand, which is 80 boxes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of friends who will be turned away. If the professor purchases 80 boxes and the mean demand is 80, then on average, the professor will sell all 80 boxes. However, the standard deviation of the demand is 20, which means the demand can vary by 20 boxes above or below the mean. Therefore, the demand can be as low as 60 boxes or as high as 100 boxes.\n\nIf the demand is 100 boxes, the professor will have 100 - 80 = 20 boxes left over. In this case, no friends will be turned away. However, if the demand is 60 boxes, the professor will have 80 - 60 = 20 boxes short, and 20 friends will be turned away.\n\nTo find the probability that the demand will be less than or equal to 80 boxes, we use the standard normal distribution. The z-score for 80 boxes is:\n\\[ z = \\frac{80 - 80}{20} = 0 \\]\n\nThe cumulative probability for a z-score of 0 is 0.5, which means there is a 50% chance that the demand will be 80 boxes or less. Therefore, there is a 50% chance that the demand will be more than 80 boxes, and in this case, 20 friends will be turned away.\n\nThus, the number of friends who will be turned away because the professor runs out of boxes of souvenirs is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",

The expected number of boxes that will dry out is 50% of the total demand, which is:\n\\[ 0.5 \\times 80 = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, the professor will turn away 40 friends because he runs out of boxes of souvenirs.

To maximize profit, the professor should purchase enough boxes to meet at least 80 boxes with high probability. A common approach is to use the service level approach, which means purchasing enough boxes to meet the demand at a certain service level. For simplicity, let's assume the professor wants to meet the demand at least 90% of the time.

If the professor buys 80 boxes and each friend buys one box, then the number of friends who will be left without a souvenir is the number of friends minus the number of boxes.

We need to find the probability that the number of DVDs sold is less than or equal to the number of DVDs ordered by MathRUs.\n\n2. **Determine the optimal number of DVDs to order:**\n   We will use the newsv method (single order method) to find the optimal number of DVDs to order. This involves calculating the critical ratio and using it to determine the optimal order quantity.\n\n3. **Calculate the expected profit:**\n   We will calculate the expected profit by considering the revenue from sales, the cost of production, and the expected returns from returns and discounts.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the expected number of DVDs sold to MathRUs\n\nGiven:\n- Price per DVD to MathRUs: \\$19.99\n- Discounted price per DVD: \\$4.99\n- Refund per unsold DVD: \\$4\n- Cost per DVD to the studio: \\$1\n\nLet \\( Q \\) be the number of DVDs ordered by MathRUs.\n\nThe profit for MathRUs can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 19.99 \\times \\text{Number of DVDs sold} - 4.99 \\times \\text{Number of DVDs sold} + 4 \\times (\\text{Number of DVDs ordered} - \\text{Number of DVDs sold}) \\]\n\nSimplifying the profit expression:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = (19.99 - 4.99 + 4) \\times \\text{Number of DVDs sold} - 4 \\times (\\text{Number of DVDs ordered} - \\text{Number of DVDs sold}) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 19 \\times \\text{Number of DVDs sold} - 4 \\times (\\text{Number of DVDs ordered} - \\text{Number of DVDs sold}) \\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the optimal number of DVDs to order\n\nTo find the optimal number of DVDs to order, we need to calculate the critical ratio.

To test the marketability of the toy, the toy store will place an initial single order for the toys. Each toy costs \u20ac8.00, and any unsold toys will have to dispose of at the end of a trial period. The margin from each toy is \u20ac4.00, and children are likely to go to competitor toy stores if they run out of this toy. The demand for the toy is forecast to be normally distributed with a mean of 30,000 and a standard deviation of 10,000. An issue has been raised that customers who go to competitor toy stores may be lost for the long term. It has been estimated that the cost of not having toys in stock is \u20ac7 per stockout because of the loss of current and future sales.

            "To determine how many toys should be ordered in advance of the trial period, we need to consider the costs of overage andquared costs of lost sales. The problem can be approached using the newsv approach in operations management, which is a method to find the optimal service level that minimizes the total cost.\n\n1. **Define the parameters:**\n   - Cost per toy (C) = \u20ac8.00\n   - margin per toy (M) = \u20ac4.00\n   - Cost of lost sales (L) = \u20ac7.00\n   - Mean demand (\u03bc) = 30,000\n   - Standard deviation of demand (\u03c3) = 10,000\n\n2. **Calculate the service probability (P):**\n   The service probability is the probability that the store will have enough toys to meet the demand. The service probability is given by the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution.\n\n   The service level (P) is the probability that the demand will not exceed the ordered quantity.

            "To determine how many toys should be ordered in advance of the trial period, we need to use the newspaper problem approach. This involves balancing the cost of ordering too many toys (which leads to lost sales due to stockouts) and the cost of ordering too few toys (which leaves customers without toys).\n\nThe cost parameters are:\n- Cost per toy ordered: \u20ac8.00\n- Revenue per toy sold: \u20ac12.00 (since the margin is \u20ac4.00)\n- Cost of lost sales due to stockouts: \u20ac7.00 per toy\n\nThe demand for the toy is normally distributed with a mean of 30,000 and a standard deviation of 10,000. The cost of a stockout is \u20ac7 per toy, and the cost of a unit sold is \u20ac4. The service level (the probability of meeting demand without a stockout) can be calculated using the service level formula for the normal distribution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-score corresponding to the service level. The service level is given by the ratio of the cost of a stockout to the sum of the cost of a stockout and the cost of a unit sold:\n\n\\[ \\text{Service level} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of a stockout}}{\\text{Cost of a stockout} + \\text{Cost of a unit sold}} = \\frac{7}{7 + 4} = \\frac{7}{11} \\approx 0.6364 \\]\n\nNext, we find the z-score corresponding to this service level from the standard normal distribution table. The z-score for a service level of 0.6364 is approximately 0.33.\n\nNow, we use the z-score to find the optimal order quantity. The optimal order quantity \\( Q \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ Q = \\mu + z \\sigma \\]\nwhere \\( \\mu \\) is the mean demand, \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of demand, and \\( z \\) is the z-score.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n\\[ Q = 30,000 + 0.33 \\times 10,000 = 30,000 + 3,300 = 33,300 \\]\n\nTherefore, the toy store should order \\(\\boxed{33300}\\) toys in advance of the trial period.",
            "To determine how many toys should be ordered in advance of the trial period, we need to consider the cost of overage and cost of backorder. The cost of overage is the cost of the toy minus the margin, which is \\(8 - 4 = 4\\) euros per toy. The cost of backorder is the margin per toy, which is 4 euros. The cost of stockout is the margin per toy plus the cost of lost sales, which is \\(4 + 7 = 11\\) euros per toy.\n\nThe optimal number of toys to order is the point where the cost of overage equals the cost of backorder. This can be calculated using the critical value from the normal distribution. The critical value \\(z\\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{\\mu - Q}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the mean demand, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of demand, and \\(Q\\) is the optimal order quantity. The critical value \\(z\\) is determined such that the cost of overage equals the cost of backorder. This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ z \\cdot \\sigma = \\mu - Q \\]\n\nRearranging for \\(Q\\), we get:\n\n\\[ Q = \\mu - z \\cdot \\sigma \\]\n\nWe need to find the value of \\(z\\) such that the cost of overage equals the cost of backorder. This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ 4 = 11 \\cdot (1 - \\Phi(z)) \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\Phi(z)\\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. Solving for \\(\\Phi(z)\\), we get:\n\n\\[ \\Phi(z) = 1 - \\frac{4}{11} = \\frac{7}{11} \\approx 0.6364 \\]\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that \\(z \\approx 0.33\\). Now we can calculate \\(Q\\):\n\n\\[ Q = 30000 - 0.33 \\cdot 10000 = 30000 - 3300 = 26700 \\]\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of toys to order in advance of the trial period is \\(\\boxed{26700}\\).",

The service level is the probability that demand will not exceed the ordered quantity, which is typically chosen to be around 95% to account for the 7% loss per stockout. The z-score for a 95% service level is approximately 1.645.\n\nThus:\n\\[ Q = 30000 + 1.645 \\times 10000 = 30000 + 16450 = 46450 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of toys that should be ordered in advance of the trial period is:\n\\[ \\boxed{46450} \\]",

The marginal production cost for the confectioner is \u20ac2.50 per cake. At M&S, the cakes are priced at \u20ac29 and the expected demand over the next two months to be normally distributed, with a mean of 8,000 and a standard deviation of 2,000. M&S places a single order with the confectioner for delivery at the beginning of the two-month period. Currently, M&S discounts any unsold cakes at the end of two months down to \u20ac5, and any cakes that did not sell at full price sell at this price. A plan under discussion is for the confectioner to refund M&S \u20ac7 per cake that does not sell during the two-month period. As before, M&S will discount them to \u20ac5 and sell any that remain. Under this plan, how many cakes will M&S order?\nassistant\n",

            "To determine how many cakes M means will order, we need to consider the profit maximization strategy under the given conditions. The confectioner sells each cake for \u20ac15 initially, but if unsold cakes remain at the end of two months, the confectioner will refund \u20ac7 per cake that does not sell. This means the confectioner will sell the unsold cakes at \u20ac5 each.\n\nLet's denote the number of cakes ordered by \\( Q \\). The demand for cakes is normally distributed with a mean of 8,000 and a standard deviation of 2,000. The profit function can be expressed as follows:\n\n1. If the demand \\( D \\) is less than or equal to the number of cakes ordered \\( Q \\), the confectioner sells all \\( D \\) cakes at \u20ac15 each and the remaining \\( Q - D \\) cakes at \u20ac5 each. The profit from selling \\( D \\) cakes is \\( 15D \\) and the profit from selling the remaining cakes is \\( 5(Q - D) \\). The total profit is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = 15D + 5(Q - D) = 10D + 5Q\n   \\]\n2. If the demand \\( D \\) is greater than the number of cakes ordered \\( Q \\), the confectioner sells all \\( Q \\) cakes at \u20ac15 each and the remaining \\( D - Q \\) cakes are returned at \u20ac7 each. The profit from selling \\( Q \\) cakes is \\( 15Q \\) and the profit from the returned cakes is \\( 7(D - Q) \\). The total profit is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = 15Q + 7(D - Q) = 8Q + 7D\n   \\]\n\nThe expected profit is the weighted average of these two scenarios, where the weights are the probabilities of each scenario occurring. However, since the demand is normally distributed, we can use the critical value approach to find the optimal \\( Q \\). The critical value is the point where the expected profit is maximized.\n\nThe critical value \\( Q^* \\) is the point where the marginal cost of producing an additional cake equals the marginal revenue from selling it. The marginal cost is \u20ac2.50 and the marginal revenue is \u20ac15 - \u20ac5 = \u20ac10 (since the revenue from selling an unsold cake at \u20ac5 is \u20ac10 less than the cost of producing it).\n\nSo, the critical value \\( Q^* \\) is:\n\\[\nQ^* = \\mu + \\sigma \\cdot z\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\mu = 8000 \\), \\( \\sigma = 2000 \\), and \\( z \\) is the standard normal variable corresponding to the marginal cost and marginal revenue. The z-score for a marginal cost of \u20ac2.50 and a marginal revenue of \u20ac10 is:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{10 - 2.50}{10} = 0.75\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\nQ^* = 8000 + 2000 \\cdot 0.75 = 8000 + 1500 = 9500\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the confectioner should order \\(\\boxed{9500}\\) cakes.",
            "To determine how many cakes M means should order, we need to consider the expected demand and the costs associated with overage and underage. The key is to find the optimal order quantity that minimizes the total expected cost, which includes the cost of the cakes, the expected revenue from sales, and the expected cost of returns or costs associated with unsold cakes.\n\nLet's denote the order quantity by \\( Q \\). The demand \\( D \\) is normally distributed with a mean of 8,000 and a standard deviation of 2,000, i.e., \\( D \\sim N(8000, 2000^2) \\).\n\nThe cost per cake is \u20ac15, and the selling price is \u20ac29. If the confectioner does not sell all the cakes, the unsold cakes are sold at \u20ac5 each. The refund for each unsold cake is \u20ac7. Therefore, the profit per cake sold is \u20ac14 (29 - 15), and the loss per cake that is not sold and returned is \u20ac12 (15 - 5 - 7).\n\nThe expected profit function can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\text{Expected Profit} = 14 \\cdot \\min(Q, D) - 15Q + 7 \\cdot \\max(Q - D, 0) \\]\n\nTo find the optimal \\( Q \\), we need to consider the critical ratio approach, which is used in new product pricing and inventory problems. The critical ratio \\( c \\) is given by:\n\\[ c = \\frac{\\text{Profit per unit sold}}{\\text{Profit per unit not sold}} = \\frac{14}{12} = \\frac{7}{6} \\approx 1.1667 \\]\n\nHowever, since the critical ratio is greater than 1, we need to adjust it to a feasible value within the range of 0 to 1. In practice, this means we should order just enough to meet the expected demand, which is the mean demand in this case because the normal distribution is symmetric and the mean is the median.\n\nGiven the normal distribution of demand with a mean of 8,000 and a standard deviation of 2,000, the optimal order quantity \\( Q \\) is the mean of the demand distribution, which is 8,000.\n\nThus, the optimal number of cakes M means should order is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8000} \\]",
            "To determine how many cakes M means will order, we need to consider the cost structure and the expected demand. The confectioner's cost per cake is \u20ac2.50, and the selling price is \u20ac15 for the first month and \u20ac29 for the second month. Any unsold cakes are discounted to \u20ac5 at the end of two months. The refund plan is \u20ac7 per cake that does not sell.\n\nFirst, we need to find the optimal order quantity that maximizes profit. This can be done using the newspaper problem approach or the critical value method. However, since we are given the demand distribution is normal with a mean of 8,000 and a standard deviation of 2,000, we can use the service level approach.\n\nThe service level is the probability that all the cakes sold will meet the demand. The cost structure and the discount at the end of the period suggest that we need to find the order quantity that balances the cost of overage and the cost of shortage.\n\nThe critical ratio ( service level) can be calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Service level} = \\frac{\\text{Selling price} - \\text{Cost price}}{\\text{Selling price} - \\text{Refund price}} = \\frac{15 - 2.50}{29 - 5 - 7} = \\frac{12.50}{17} \\approx 0.7353 \\]\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table, the z-score corresponding to a service level of 0.7353 is approximately 0.61. The optimal order quantity can be found by converting this z-score back to the demand scale:\n\\[ Q = \\mu + z \\cdot \\sigma = 8000 + 0.61 \\cdot 2000 = 8000 + 1220 = 9220 \\]\n\nTherefore, the confectioner should order \\(\\boxed{9220}\\) cakes.",
            "To determine how many cakes M means will order, we need to consider the costs and revenues associated with different quantities of cakes ordered. We will use the newsv approach to find the optimal order quantity. The newsv approach involves calculating the service probability for different order quantities and choosing the one that maximizes the service probability for a given service level.\n\nFirst, let's define the parameters:\n- Price per cake (P) = \u20ac29\n- Marginal cost per cake (C) = \u20ac2.50\n- Discounted price per cake (D) = \u20ac5\n- Refund per unsold cake (R) = \u20ac7\n- Marginal revenue per cake sold = P - C = \u20ac29 - \u20ac2.50 = \u20ac26.50\n- Marginal cost per cake = \u20ac2.50\n- Marginal profit per cake sold = \u20ac26.50 - \u20ac2.50 = \u20ac24\n- Marginal loss per cake unsold = \u20ac5 - \u20ac2.50 = \u20ac2.50\n- Marginal refund per unsold cake = \u20ac7 - \u20ac5 = \u20ac2\n- Net loss per unsold cake = \u20ac2.50 - \u20ac2 = \u20ac0.50\n\nWe need to find the optimal order quantity that maximizes the service probability.

            "To determine the total cost for Top oil to ship to each customer separately, we need to calculate the cost for each delivery separately and then sum them up. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost to ship to each customer separately:**\n   - **Nashville:** The demand is 60 tons. Since the truck capacity is 12 tons, Top oil will need to make 5 trips (60 / 12 = 5). The cost per trip is $800 + $250 \\times 5 = $800 + $1250 = $2050$. The cost for one delivery is $1050$, which includes $800 + $250 \\times 1 = $1050$. Since the cost per trip is $2050$, we use the fixed cost of $1050$ per delivery.\n   - **Tenns**: The demand is 24 tons. Since the truck capacity is 12 tons, Top oil will need to make 2 trips (24 / 12 = 2). The cost per trip is $800 + $250 \\times 2 = $800 + $500 = $1300$. The cost for one delivery is $1050$, which includes $800 + $250 \\times 1 = $1050$. Since the cost per trip is $1300$, we use the fixed cost of $1050$ per delivery.\n   - ** small customer:** The demand is 8 tons. Since the truck capacity is 12 tons, Top oil will need to make 1 trip (8 / 12 = 1). The cost per trip is $800 + $250 \\times 1 = $800 + $250 = $1050$. The cost for one delivery is $1050$, which includes $800 + $250 \\times 1 = $1050$. Since the cost per trip is $1050$, we use the fixed cost of $1050$ per delivery.\n\n2. **Sum the costs for each delivery:**\n   - Cost for 60 tons to\u83f1ine: $1050$\n   - Cost for 24 tons to Hamilton: $1050$\n   - Cost for 8 tons to Vicksburg: $1050$\n   - Total cost = $1050 + $1050 + $1050 = $3150$\n\nThus, the total cost if Top oil ships a full truckload to each customer when they are running out of stock is \\(\\boxed{3150}\\).",
            "To determine the total cost if TopOil ships a full truckload to each customer when they are running out of stock, we need to calculate the cost of transportation and the cost of holding inventory for each customer.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of shipping to each customer separately:\n- The cost per truck is $1,050.\n- The cost per truck is $800 plus $250 per stop. To find the number of stops, we need to know the distance to each customer.

Therefore, Top oil will need to make 60 / 12 = 5 trips.\n- The cost per truck is $800 plus $250 per stop. Since there are 5 stops, the total cost is $800 + 5 * $250 = $800 + $1250 = $2050.\n\nThe cost to deliver toBennings on a single truck is $2050.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of holding inventory for each customer:\n- The product cost is $10,000 per ton.\n- The annual holding cost is 25% of the product cost, which is $10,000 * 0.25 = $2,500 per ton.\n- The inventory cost for each customer is the product of the annual holding cost and the number of tons delivered.\n\nForBennings:\n- The inventory cost is $2,500 * 60 = $150,000.\n\nForTenns:\n- The inventory cost is $2,500 * 24 = $60,000.\n\nForCape May:\n- The inventory cost is $2,500 * 8 = $20,000.\n\nThe total inventory cost is $150,000 + $60,000 + $20,000 = $230,000.\n\nFinally, the total cost if Top oilagates all deliveries toBennings on a single truck is the sum of the shipping cost and the inventory cost:\n- Shipping cost is $2050.\n- Inventory cost is $230,000.\n\nThe total cost is $2050 + $230,000 = $232,050.\n\nThe total cost if Top oil ships a full truckload to each customer when they are running out of stock is \\boxed{232050}.",

The cost of a truck is $800 plus $250 per stop. Since each customer is served separately, each customer requires a stop, so the cost per truck is $800 + $250 = $1050.\n2. The demand at the large customer is 60 tons per year, so the cost for the large customer is $1050 * 60 / 12 = $5250.\n3. The demand at the medium customer is 24 tons per year, so the cost for the medium customer is $1050 * 24 / 12 = $2100.\n4. The demand at the small customer is 8 tons per year, so the cost for the small customer is $1050 * 8 / 12 = $700.\n5.

            "To determine the total cost if Top oil ships a full truckload to each customer when they are running out of stock, we need to calculate the cost of shipping for each customer and the cost of holding inventory for each customer.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the shipping cost for each customer when they are running out of stock:\n- The demand at the large customer is 60 tons a year. Since the truck capacity is 12 tons, Top oil will need to make 60/12 = 5 trips. The cost per truck is $800 + $250 * (5 - 1) = $800 + $250 * 4 = $800 + $1000 = $1800. So, the cost to deliver to the large customer is $1800.\n- The demand at the medium customer is 24 tons a year. Since the truck capacity is 12 tons, Top oil will need to make 24/12 = 2 trips. The cost per truck is $800 + $250 * (2 - 1) = $800 + $250 = $1050. So, the cost to deliver to the medium customer is $1050.\n- The demand at the small customer is 8 tons a year. Since the truck capacity is 12 tons, Top oil will need to make 8/12 = 1 trip (since the truck can only carry 12 tons and 8 tons is less than 12 tons). The cost per truck is $800 + $250 * (1 - 1) = $800. So, the cost to deliver to the small customer is $800.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total shipping cost:\n\\[ 1800 + 1050 + 800 = 3650 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the inventory cost for each customer. The inventory cost is 25% of the product cost per ton times the average inventory.\n\n- For the large customer, the average inventory is 60/2 = 30 tons. The product cost is $10,000 per ton, so the inventory cost is 0.25 * $10,000 * 30 = $75000.\n- For the medium customer, the average inventory is 24/2 = 12 tons. The inventory cost is 0.25 * $10,000 * 12 = $30000.\n- For the small customer, the average inventory is 8/2 = 4 tons. The inventory cost is 0.25 * $10,000 * 4 = $10000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total inventory cost:\n\\[ 75000 + 30000 + 10000 = 115000 \\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total cost, which is the sum of the shipping cost and the inventory cost:\n\\[ 3650 + 115000 = 118650 \\]\n\nSo, the total cost if Top oil ships a full truckload to each customer when they are running out of stock is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{118650}\n\\]"
