            "To determine the cost of understocking that justifies the current policy, we need to calculate the expected holding cost and the expected back-order cost. The policy is to order 200 bottles when the quantity on hand drops below 45, which means the average inventory is (45 + 200)/2 = 122.5 bottles.\n\nFirst, we calculate the expected holding cost. The holding cost per bottle per year is 25% of the cost of the bottle, which is 0.25 * \\$4 = \\$1. The average inventory is 122.5 bottles, so the expected holding cost is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected holding cost} = 122.5 \\times 1 = \\$122.5 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the expected back orders. The demand is normally distributed with a mean of 40 bottles and a standard deviation of 5 bottles. The policy is to order 200 bottles when the inventory drops to 45 bottles. This means that if the demand is less than 45 bottles, there will be no back orders, but if the demand is 45 bottles or more, there will be back orders equal to the demand minus 45 bottles.\n\nThe probability that the demand is less than 45 bottles is the probability that a normally distributed variable with mean 40 and standard deviation 5 is less than 45. This probability is:\n\\[ P(X < 45) = P\\left(Z < \\frac{45 - 40}{5}\\right) = P(Z < 1) \\approx 0.8413 \\]\nThis means that the probability that the demand is 45 bottles or more is:\n\\[ P(X \\geq 45) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 \\]\n\nThe expected back order quantity is the expected value of the excess demand over 45 bottles, which is the expected value of \\(X - 45\\) given that \\(X \\geq 45\\). This is:\n\\[ E(X - 45 \\mid X \\geq 45) = \\frac{\\int_{45}^{\\infty} (x - 45) \\cdot \\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x-40)^2}{50}} \\, dx}{P(X \\geq 45)} \\]\nThis integral is complex, but we can approximate it using the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution. The expected back order quantity is approximately:\n\\[ E(X - 45 \\mid X \\geq 45) \\approx 5 \\times 0.1587 = 0.7935 \\]\nThis is the expected number of bottles back_ordered per day. The expected back order cost per year is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected back order cost} = 0.7935 \\times 365 \\times 1 = \\$289.97 \\]\n\nThe total expected cost per year is the sum of the expected holding cost and the expected back order cost:\n\\[ \\text{Total expected cost} = 122.5 + 289.97 = \\$412.47 \\]\n\nThe cost of understocking is the total expected cost minus the cost of the average inventory:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of understocking} = 412.47 - 122.5 = \\$289.97 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of understocking that justifies the current policy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{289.97} \\]",
            "To determine the cost of understocking that justifies the current policy, we need to calculate the expected holding cost and the expected back order cost. The optimal policy would balance these two costs. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Identify the parameters:**\n   - Mean daily demand, \\(\\mu = 40\\) bottles\n   - Standard deviation of daily demand, \\(\\sigma = 5\\) bottles\n   - Re order point, \\(R = 45\\) bottles\n   - lead time, \\(L = 1\\) day\n   - Cost per bottle, \\(C = \\$4\\)\n   - Annual holding cost rate, \\(h = 25\\%\\)\n\n2. **Calculate the average inventory:**\n   The average inventory is the sum of the lead time demand and the safety stock. The lead time demand is the mean demand over the lead time, which is 40 bottles. The safety stock is the difference between the re order point and the lead time mean demand, which is \\(45 - 40 = 5\\) bottles. Therefore, the average inventory is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average inventory} = 40 + 5 = 45 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the annual holding cost:**\n   The annual holding cost is the average inventory multiplied by the cost per bottle and the annual holding cost rate. The cost per bottle is \\$4, and the annual holding cost rate is 25%, so the annual holding cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual holding cost} = 45 \\times 4 \\times 0.25 = \\$45\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the expected back order cost:**\n   The expected back order cost is the expected number of back orders multiplied by the cost per bottle. The expected number of back orders is the expected number of days that the inventory is negative. This can be calculated using the standard normal distribution. The critical value for the service level is the re order point minus the lead time mean demand, which is 5 bottles. The z-score corresponding to this critical value is:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{45 - 40}{5} = 1\n   \\]\n   The probability that the demand exceeds the re order point is the area to the right of z = 1 in the standard normal distribution, which is 0.1587. The expected number of back orders per day is the lead time (1 day) times the probability of a back order, which is 0.1587. Therefore, the expected number of back orders per day is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected back orders per day} = 1 \\times 0.1587 = 0.1587\n   \\]\n   The expected back order cost is the expected number of back orders per day times the cost per bottle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected back order cost} = 0.1587 \\times 4 = \\$0.6348\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total annual cost:**\n   The total annual cost is the sum of the annual holding cost and the expected back order cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total annual cost} = 45 + 0.6348 = \\$45.6348\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the cost of understocking:**\n   The cost of under stock is the total annual cost minus the annual holding cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of under stock} = 45.6348 - 45 = \\$0.6348\n   \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest cent, the cost of under stock that justifies the current policy is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.63}\n\\]",

The daily demand is normally distributed with a mean of 40 and a standard deviation of 5. We need to find the probability that the demand exceeds 200 bottles when the inventory is at 45 bottles. This is equivalent to finding the probability that the demand exceeds 155 bottles (since 200 - 45 = 155).\n\n   The z-score for 155 bottles is:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{155 - 40}{5} = \\frac{115}{5} = 23\n   \\]\n   This z-score is extremely high, indicating that the probability of demand exceeding 155 bottles is extremely low (essentially zero in practical terms).\n\n2. **Expected Backagon Cost:**\n   The expected backagon cost is the expected number of bottles backagon multiplied by the cost per bottle and the annual holding cost. Since the probability of under stock is essentially zero, the expected backagon cost is also essentially zero.\n\n3. **Expected holding cost:**\n   The expected holding cost is the expected value of the inventory level when it is not empty, multiplied by the holding cost rate. The inventory level when it is not empty is normally distributed with a mean of 40 bottles and a standard deviation of 5 bottles. The expected inventory level is the mean of this distribution, which is 40 bottles.

This means that the manufacturer should ensure that at least 83.33% of the time, he can meet the demand for the product. Therefore, the optimal cycle service level is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.8333} \\]",
            "To determine the optimal cycle service level, we need to find the probability that demand will not exceed the inventory level at the end of the season. This probability is known as the service level and is typically denoted by \\( \\Phi \\).\n\nFirst, let's define the variables and the cost structure:\n- The mean demand, \\( \\mu = 100 \\)\n- The standard deviation of demand, \\( \\sigma = 50 \\)\n- The manufacturing cost per unit, \\( C = 75 \\)\n- The introductory price per unit, \\( P = 125 \\)\n- The residue value per unit at the end of the season, \\( S = 25 \\)\n- The holding cost per unit per season, \\( H = 10 \\)\n\nThe optimal cycle service level, \\( \\Phi \\), is the probability that the demand will not exceed the inventory level at the end of the season. To find this, we need to determine the critical ratio, which is the ratio of the profit from satisfying the demand to the total cost of satisfying the demand.\n\nThe critical ratio is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Critical Ratio} = \\frac{P - C}{P - C + H} = \\frac{125 - 75}{125 - 75 + 10} = \\frac{50}{60} = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.8333 \\]\n\nThe critical ratio corresponds to the cumulative distribution function (CDF) value of the standard normal distribution. We need to find the z-score corresponding to a CDF of 0.8333. Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the z-score is approximately 0.96.\n\nNow, we can find the optimal cycle service level by converting the z-score back to the original demand scale:\n\\[ \\text{Optimal Cycle Service Level} = \\Phi(0.96) \\]\n\nFrom the standard normal distribution table, we know that:\n\\[ \\Phi(0.96) \\approx 0.83 \\]\n\nTherefore, the optimal cycle service level is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.83} \\]",

            "To determine how much production capacity the manufacturer should reserved for the last day, we need to consider the probability that demand for the high-price segment will exceed the manufacturer's production capacity. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Identify the demand distribution**: The demand for the high-price segment is normally distributed with a mean of 250 units and a standard deviation of 100 units. We denote this as \\( N(250, 100^2) \\).\n\n2. **Determine the critical value**: We need to find the value of production capacity that ensures the probability of meeting the demand is high enough. Since the manufacturer has a production capacity of 1,000 units per day and all capacity gets booked about one week in advance, we can assume that the manufacturer is not necessarily limited by capacity for the last day. However, we need to find the capacity that minimizes the risk of not meeting the highprice segment's demand.\n\n3. **Calculate the probability of meeting the demand**: We need to find the value of production capacity \\( x \\) such that the probability of demand being less than or equal to \\( x \\) is high. Given that the demand is normally distributed, we can use the standard normal distribution table to find the corresponding z-score for a high probability (e.g., 95% or 99%).\n\n   For a 99% service level, the z-score is approximately 2.33. Therefore, the production capacity \\( x \\) can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   x = \\mu + z \\cdot \\sigma = 250 + 2.33 \\cdot 100 = 483\n   \\]\n   This means that the manufacturer should reserved production for 483 units to have a 99% chance of meeting the highprice segment's demand.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The manufacturer should reserve production for 483 units for the last day to ensure a high probability of meeting the highprice segment's demand.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{483}\n\\]",

This can be written as \\(D \\sim N(250, 100^2)\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the z-score:**\n   We need to find the z-score corresponding to the point where the demand is 1000 units. The z-score is given by:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{1000 - 250}{100} = 7.5\n   \\]\n   This z-score tells us how many standard deviations 1000 units is above the mean.\n\n3. **Find the probability:**\n   Using standard normal distribution tables or a calculator, we find the probability that the demand is less than 1000 units. The probability that \\(D < 1000\\) is essentially 1 (or 100%) because the z-score of 7.5 is extremely high, indicating that the demand of 1000 units is far in the tail of the distribution. Therefore, the probability that the demand is at least 1000 units is:\n   \\[\n   P(D \\geq 1000) = 1 - P(D < 1000) \\approx 1 - 1 = 0\n   \\]\n   However, in practical terms, we can consider the probability to be so small that it is effectively zero. For the purpose of this problem, we can assume that the manufacturer should reserved capacity for the entire production capacity of 1000 units to meet the high-price segment.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Since the probability of meeting the high-price segment's demand is effectively zero, the manufacturer should reserved the entire production capacity of 1000 units for the last day. However, in a more practical scenario, the manufacturer might want to reserved some capacity to account for the possibility of high demand, but given the high z-score, it is reasonable to assume they should reserve the entire capacity.\n\nTherefore, the manufacturer should reserve \\(\\boxed{1000}\\) units of production capacity for the last day.",

Therefore, we can find the corresponding demand level using the z-score formula:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n   \\]\n   Setting \\( z = 0 \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   0 = \\frac{x - 100}{50} \\implies x = 100\n   \\]\n   This means the optimal production quantity is 100 units.\n\nTherefore, the number of units that should be manufactured for sale is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
            "To determine the optimal number of units to manufacture for sale, we need to consider the costs and revenues associated with different levels of demand. The goal is to maximize profit, which is the difference between total revenue and total cost.\n\nLet's define the variables and costs:\n- \\( Q \\) = number of units manufactured for sale\n- \\( D \\) = demand, which is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 100 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 50 \\)\n- \\( C \\) = cost to manufacture each unit = \\$75\n- \\( P \\) = price at which each unit is sold = \\$125\n- \\( R \\) = residue price for unsold units = \\$25\n- \\( H \\) = holding cost per unit = \\$10\n\nThe profit function \\( \\Pi \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\Pi = P \\cdot \\min(Q, D) + R \\cdot \\max(Q - D, 0) - C \\cdot Q - H \\cdot \\max(Q - D, 0) \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \\Pi = P \\cdot \\min(Q, D) + (R - H) \\cdot \\max(Q - D, 0) - C \\cdot Q \\]\n\nTo maximize profit, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that balances the expected revenue and cost. A common approach is to use the critical value method, which involves finding the value of \\( Q \\) such that the expected profit is maximized. This is often done by solving for the point where the expected profit is equal to the expected cost.\n\nThe expected profit can be approximated using the normal distribution properties. The optimal \\( Q \\) is typically found by solving:\n\\[ P \\cdot E[\\min(Q, D)] + (R - H) \\cdot E[\\max(Q - D, 0)] - C \\cdot Q = \\text{constant} \\]\n\nUsing the properties of the normal distribution, we can find that the optimal \\( Q \\) is approximately:\n\\[ Q = \\mu + z \\cdot \\sigma \\]\nwhere \\( z \\) is the standard normal variable corresponding to the desired service level. For a 90% service level (which is a common choice to balance between overage and shortage costs), \\( z \\approx 1.28 \\).\n\nSo,\n\\[ Q = 100 + 1.28 \\cdot 50 = 100 + 64 = 164 \\]\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of units to manufacture for sale is:\n\\[ \\boxed{164} \\]",

The critical ratio \\( c \\) is given by:\n\\[ c = \\frac{125 - 75}{125 - 25} = \\frac{50}{100} = 0.5 \\]\n\nThis means that the optimal \\( Q \\) is the value such that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the demand \\( D \\) is equal to 0.5. Since \\( D \\) is normally distributed with mean 100 and standard deviation 50, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) such that:\n\\[ P(D \\le Q) = 0.5 \\]\n\nThis corresponds to the median of the normal distribution, which is equal to the mean.

However, we can use a rule of thumb for normal distributions, which is to produce a quantity that is slightly above the expected demand to account for the holding cost. A common approach is to use the service level method or the service level approach, but here we will use a simpler approach by checking the critical value for the normal distribution.\n\nThe critical value for the normal distribution can be found using the standard normal distribution table. We need to find the value of \\( Q \\) such that the probability of demand being less than or equal to \\( Q \\) is equal to the ratio of the holding cost to the sum of the profit per unit sold and the holding cost per unit.\n\nThe ratio is:\n\\[ \\frac{10}{50 + 10} = \\frac{10}{60} = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.1667 \\]\n\nWe need to find the z-score corresponding to the cumulative probability of 0.8333 (since the probability of demand being less than or equal to \\( Q \\) is 0.8333).

            "To evaluate the cost of stocking out implied by the current replenishment policy, we need to determine the expected back orders and the associated holding cost. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Determine the lead time demand distribution:**\n   The lead time demand is the demand over the replenishment lead time. Since the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 100 gallons and a standard deviation of 20 gallons, the lead time demand is also normally distributed with a mean of \\(100 \\times 2 = 200\\) gallons and a standard deviation of \\(20 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 28.28\\) gallons.\n\n2. **Calculate the service level:**\n   The store manager orders 400 gallons when the inventory drops to 300 gallons. This means that the store manager is satisfied if the demand during the lead time is less than or equal to 100 gallons (400 - 300). We need to find the probability that the lead time demand is less than or equal to 100 gallons.\n   \n   Let \\(X\\) be the lead time demand. Then \\(X \\sim N(200, 28.28^2)\\). We need to find \\(P(X \\leq 100)\\).\n   \n   The z-score for 100 gallons is:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{100 - 200}{28.28} \\approx -3.53\n   \\]\n   Using the standard normal distribution table, \\(P(Z \\leq -3.53) \\approx 0.0002\\). This is the probability that the demand will exceed 100 gallons, which is the probability of a stockout. Therefore, the service level is \\(1 - 0.0002 = 0.9998\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the expected back orders:**\n   The expected back orders are the expected value of the excess demand over the lead time when the inventory falls to 300 gallons. This is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected back orders} = (200 - 100) \\times 0.0002 = 100 \\times 0.0002 = 0.02 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the holding cost:**\n   The holding cost is 20% of the cost of the detergent. The cost per gallon is \\$3, so the holding cost per gallon per year is \\(0.20 \\times 3 = \\$0.60\\). The expected holding cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected holding cost} = 0.02 \\times 0.60 = \\$0.012\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of stocking out implied by the current replenishment policy is \\(\\boxed{0.012}\\).",

We need to find the probability that the lead time demand is 100 gallons or more. This is the complement of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution with mean 200 and standard deviation 28.28 evaluated at 99.5 (since we are looking for the probability of demand being 100 or more, we use 99.5 to account for the continuity correction).\n\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{ back order}) = P(D \\times L \\geq 100) = P\\left(Z \\geq \\frac{99.5 - 200}{28.28}\\right) = P\\left(Z \\geq -6.08\\right) \\approx 1\n   \\]\n\n   This means the probability of a back order is very close to 1, but we need to calculate the expected number of back orders per year.\n\n3. **Calculate the expected number of back orders per cycle:**\n   The expected number of back orders per cycle is the probability of a back order times the lead time demand when a back order occurs. Since the lead time demand is normally distributed with a mean of 200 gallons and a standard deviation of 28.28 gallons, the probability of a back order is approximately 1 (since the mean is 200 and the lead time demand is 99.5 when there is a back order).\n\n   The expected number of back orders per cycle is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected back orders per cycle} = P(\\text{back order}) \\times (200 - 100) = 1 \\times 100 = 100\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the annual expected number of back orders:**\n   Since the lead time is 2 weeks, there are 52 weeks in a year, so the annual expected number of back orders is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual expected back orders} = 100 \\times 26 = 2600\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the annual holding cost for the back orders:**\n   The holding cost per gallon is 20% of the cost of the detergent, which is \\(0.2 \\times 3 = 0.6\\) dollars per gallon. The annual holding cost for the back orders is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual holding cost for back orders} = 2600 \\times 0.6 = 1560\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of stocking out implied by the current replenishment policy is \\(\\boxed{1560}\\).",

Since the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 100 gallons and a standard deviation of 20 gallons, the lead time demand is also normally distributed with a mean of \\(2 \\times 100 = 200\\) gallons and a standard deviation of \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times 20 \\approx 28.28\\) gallons.\n\n2. **Calculate the probability of stockouts:**\n   The store manager orders 400 gallons when the available inventory drops to 300 gallons. This means that the store will have 300 gallons plus the lead time demand. The store will need to order more if the lead time demand exceeds 100 gallons (since 300 + 100 = 400). Therefore, we need to find the probability that the lead time demand exceeds 100 gallons.\n   The lead time demand is normally distributed with a mean of 200 gallons and a standard deviation of 28.28 gallons. We standardize the value 100 gallons:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{100 - 200}{28.28} \\approx -3.53\n   \\]\n   Using the standard normal distribution table, the probability that the lead time demand is less than 100 gallons is approximately 0.0002. Therefore, the probability that the lead time demand exceeds 100 gallons is:\n   \\[\n   1 - 0.0002 = 0.9998\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the average inventory level:**\n   The average inventory level is the average of the initial inventory level and the lead time demand minus the lead time demand when the store is out of stock. Since the store is out of stock when the lead time demand exceeds 100 gallons, the average inventory level is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average inventory} = \\frac{300 + (300 + 200)}{2} = \\frac{300 + 500}{2} = 400 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   However, this is not the correct way to calculate the average inventory level because we need to consider the lead time demand when the store is out of stock. The correct way is to use the probability of stockouts and the lead time demand:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average inventory} = 300 + \\left(200 - 100\\right) \\times 0.9998 = 300 + 100 \\times 0.9998 = 300 + 99.98 = 399.98 \\approx 400 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the annual holding cost:**\n   The annual holding cost is 20% of the cost of the average inventory. The cost per gallon is \\$3, so the cost per gallon of inventory is \\$3. The annual holding cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual holding cost} = 0.20 \\times 3 \\times 400 = 240\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of stocking out implied by the current replenishment policy is \\(\\boxed{240}\\).",
            "To evaluate the cost of stocking out implied by the current replenishment policy, we need to determine the fill rate and then use it to calculate the holding cost.\n\nFirst, let's define the parameters:\n- Mean weekly demand, \\(D = 100\\) gallons\n- Standard deviation of weekly demand, \\(\\sigma_D = 20\\) gallons\n- Re order point, \\(R = 300\\) gallons\n- lead time, \\(L = 2\\) weeks\n- Cost per gallon, \\(C = \\$3\\)\n- Annual holding cost rate, \\(h = 20\\%\\)\n\nThe total demand during the lead time is normally distributed with mean \\(100 \\times 2 = 200\\) gallons and standard deviation \\(\\sigma_D \\times \\sqrt{L} = 20 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 28.28\\) gallons.\n\nThe z-score corresponding to the order point (300 gallons) is calculated as follows:\n\\[ z = \\frac{300 - 200}{28.28} \\approx 3.53 \\]\n\nFrom the standard normal distribution table, the probability that the demand during the lead time exceeds 300 gallons (i.e., the fill rate) is approximately 0.0002. This means the fill rate is very low, and the probability of not satisfying the demand (i.e., the probability of stocking out) is 1 - 0.0002 = 0.9998.\n\nThe expected back orders per week is the probability of stocking out times the lead time demand. Since the lead time demand is normally distributed with mean 200 gallons and standard deviation 28.28 gallons, the expected back orders per week is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected back orders per week} = 0.0002 \\times 28.28 \\approx 0.005656 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nThe annual expected back orders is:\n\\[ \\text{Annual expected back orders} = 0.005656 \\times 52 \\approx 0.293 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nThe annual holding cost is:\n\\[ \\text{Annual holding cost} = 0.293 \\times 3 \\times 0.20 = 0.1758 \\approx 0.18 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of stocking out implied by the current replenishment policy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.18} \\]"

The maximum total demand is 900 parkas, so the retailer should purchase 900 parkas at the beginning of the season.\n\nTherefore, the number of parkas the retailer should purchase at the beginning of the season to maximize profits is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{900}\n\\]",
            "To determine how many parkas the retailer should purchase at the beginning of the season to maximize profits, we need to consider the forecasted demand and the cost structure. Let's denote the number of parkas purchased at the beginning of the season by \\( P \\). The demand in each month is given by the functions \\( d_1 = 300 - p_1 \\), \\( d_2 = 300 - 1.3 \\times p_2 \\), and \\( d_3 = 300 - 1.8 \\times p_3 \\). The cost of each ski parka is $100.\n\nThe profit function is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total revenue is the number of parkas sold multiplied by the price, and the total cost is the number of parkas purchased multiplied by the cost per parka. Since the retailer wants to maximize profit, we need to consider the maximum demand over the three months.\n\nThe total demand over the three months is the sum of the demand in each month:\n\\[ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = (300 - p_1) + (300 - 1.3 \\times p_2) + (300 - 1.8 \\times p_3) = 900 - p_1 - 1.3 \\times p_2 - 1.8 \\times p_3. \\]\n\nSince the retailer wants to maximize profit, it should purchase enough parkas to meet the highest demand. The highest demand will be the maximum of the three demand functions. However, since the prices \\( p_1 \\), \\( p_2 \\), and \\( p_3 \\) are not given, we assume that the prices are set such that the demand is maximized. The maximum demand will be the maximum of the three functions, but since we don't have specific prices, we consider the maximum possible demand, which is the maximum value of the three functions when the prices are set to minimize the demand, i.e., when the prices are set such that the demand is maximized.\n\nThe maximum demand is the maximum of the three functions, but since we don't have specific prices, we consider the maximum possible demand, which is the maximum value of the three functions when the prices are set to minimize the demand, i.e., when the prices are set such that the demand is maximized.
