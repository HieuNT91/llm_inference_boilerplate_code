            "To determine the average order size, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 4 weeks, and the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 3,000 handbags. Therefore, the expected demand during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected demand during lead time} = 4 \\times 3000 = 12000 \\text{ handbags}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is the additional inventory kept to account for variability in demand during the lead time. Since the lead time is 4 weeks, we need to find the 4th standard deviation of the weekly demand distribution. The standard deviation of the weekly demand is 1,000 handbags. Therefore, the 4th standard deviation is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{4th standard deviation} = 4 \\times 1000 = 4000 \\text{ handbags}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the target inventory level:**\n   The target inventory level is the sum of the expected demand during the lead time and the safety stock:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Target inventory level} = 12000 + 4000 = 16000 \\text{ handbags}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the current inventory:**\n   The current inventory is the target inventory level minus the average number of handbags sold during the order interval. The order interval is 12 weeks, so the average number of handbags sold during the order interval is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average number of handbags sold during order interval} = 12 \\times 3000 = 36000 \\text{ handbags}\n   \\]\n   Since the current inventory is the target inventory level, it is 50,000 handbags. Therefore, the average number of handbags sold during the order interval is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average number of handbags sold during order interval} = 50000 - 16000 = 34000 \\text{ handbags}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the average order size:**\n   The average order size is the difference between the target inventory level and the current inventory:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average order size} = 50000 - 16000 = 34000 \\text{ handbags}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average order size is \\(\\boxed{34000}\\).",

The lead time is 4 weeks, so the safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ safety stock} = \\sigma \\times \\sqrt{\\text{ lead time}} = 1000 \\times \\sqrt{4} = 1000 \\times 2 = 2000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the order-up-to level:**\n   The order-up-to level is the total demand during the review period plus the safety stock:\n   \\[\n   \\text{order-up-to level} = \\text{total demand} + \\text{safety stock} = 36000 + 2000 = 38000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the current inventory:**\n   The current inventory is the order-up-to level minus the back orders. Since no back orders are currently in play, the current inventory is equal to the order-up-to level:\n   \\[\n   \\text{current inventory} = 50000\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the average order size:**\n   The average order size is the difference between the order-up-to level and the current inventory:\n   \\[\n   \\text{average order size} = \\text{order-up-to level} - \\text{current inventory} = 50000 - 38000 = 12000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average order size is \\(\\boxed{12000}\\).",

The safety stock (\\(SS\\)) for each color is given by:\n\\[ SS = z \\times \\sigma_{\\text{total}} \\]\nwhere \\(z = 1.645\\) and \\(\\sigma_{\\text{total}} = 14.14\\).\n\nSo, the safety stock for each color is:\n\\[ SS = 1.645 \\times 14.14 \\approx 23.28 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total safety stock for all 100 colors of paint\nSince the retailer holds base paint (supplied by the paint factory) and mixes colors on demand, the safety stock for each color of paint is the same. Therefore, the total safety stock for all 100 colors is:\n\\[ \\text{Total safety stock} = 100 \\times 23.28 = 2328 \\]\n\nThus, the retailer will have to hold \\(\\boxed{2328}\\) units of safety stock.",

            "To determine the supply chain profits with an independent retailer, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the optimal number of compact discs to supply to the retailer.**\n2. **Calculate the profit for the supplier, the retailer, and the entire supply chain.**\n\n### Step 1: Determine the optimal number of compact discs to supply to the retailer\n\nThe optimal number of compact discs to supply to the retailer is the point where the marginal cost of producing an additional disc equals the marginal revenue from selling that disc. Since the cost of producing each disc is \\$1 and the selling price to the end consumer is \\$10, the marginal revenue is \\$10. Therefore, the optimal number of compact discs to supply is the number that maximizes the retailer's profit.\n\nThe retailer's profit is maximized when the retailer can meet the market demand without running out of compact discs. Since the market demand is normally distributed with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 300, the retailer should supply up to the point where the demand is 1,000 compact discs, as this is the mean and the most likely demand.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the profit for the supplier, the retailer, and the entire supply chain\n\n**\u5229\u6da6 for the supplier:**\nThe supplier produces 1,000 compact discs and sells them to the retailer at \\$5 each. The cost to the supplier is \\$1 per disc.\n\\[\n\\text{Profit for the supplier} = 1000 \\times (5 - 1) = 1000 \\times 4 = 4000\n\\]\n\n**Profit for the retailer:**\nThe retailer buys 1,000 compact discs from the supplier and sells them to the end consumer at \\$10 each. The cost to the retailer is \\$1 per disc.\n\\[\n\\text{Profit for the retailer} = 1000 \\times (10 - 1) = 1000 \\times 9 = 9000\n\\]\n\n**Profit for the entire supply chain:**\nThe entire supply chain profit is the sum of the profits of the supplier and the retailer.\n\\[\n\\text{Profit for the entire supply chain} = 4000 + 9000 = 13000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the supply chain profits with an independent retailer are \\(\\boxed{13000}\\).",
            "To determine the supply chain profits with an independent retailer, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the optimal order quantity for the supplier:**\n   - The supplier's goal is to maximize profit. The supplier sells each disc to the retailer at \\$5 and buys each disc from the retailer at \\$1. Therefore, the profit per disc sold is \\$4 (\\$5 - \\$1).\n   - The retailer sells each disc to the end consumer at \\$10. If the retailer has leftover discs, they incurs a cost of \\$0 (since leftover discs are indefinitely lost).\n\n2. **Calculate the critical ratio:**\n   - The critical ratio is the probability that the retailer will meet the market demand. It is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Critical Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Selling Price} - \\text{Cost Price}}{\\text{Selling Price} - \\text{Cost Price} + \\text{Cost of leftover discs}}\n     \\]\n     Here, the selling price is \\$10, the cost price is \\$5, and the cost of leftover discs is \\$0. Thus, the critical ratio is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Critical Ratio} = \\frac{10 - 5}{10 - 5 + 0} = \\frac{5}{5} = 1\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the optimal service level:**\n   - Since the critical ratio is 1, it means the retailer will always meet the market demand. This implies that the supplier should produce enough discs to meet the entire market demand.\n\n4. **Calculate the optimal order quantity:**\n   - The optimal order quantity is the mean of the market demand, which is 1,000 units.\n\n5. **Calculate the total profit:**\n   - The supplier's profit per unit is \\$4 (\\$5 - \\$1).\n   - The total profit for the supplier is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Profit} = \\text{Profit per unit} \\times \\text{Number of units ordered}\n     \\]\n     Substituting the values, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Profit} = 4 \\times 1000 = 4000\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the supply chain profits with an independent retailer are \\(\\boxed{4000}\\).",

The expected demand is given by the mean of the normal distribution, which is 1,000.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the profit for the supplier\n\nThe supplier's profit is calculated as follows:\n- Revenue from selling the compact discs to the retailer: \\(1000 \\times 5 = 5000\\) dollars.\n- Cost of producing the compact discs: \\(1000 \\times 1 = 1000\\) dollars.\n- Profit for the supplier: \\(5000 - 1000 = 4000\\) dollars.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the profit for the retailer\n\nThe retailer's profit is calculated as follows:\n- Revenue from selling the compact discs to the end consumer: \\(1000 \\times 10 = 10000\\) dollars.\n- Cost of buying the compact discs from the supplier: \\(1000 \\times 5 = 5000\\) dollars.\n- Profit for the retailer: \\(10000 - 5000 = 5000\\) dollars.\n\n### Step 4: Sum the profits of the supplier and the retailer to get the total supply chain profit\n\nThe total supply chain profit is the sum of the supplier's profit and the retailer's profit:\n\\[4000 + 5000 = 9000\\]\n\nThus, the total supply chain profit is \\(\\boxed{9000}\\).",

This is because the retailer should order enough to meet the expected demand to maximize profit.\n\n3. **Calculate the profit for the retailer:**\n   - Revenue from selling 1,000 units: \\(1,000 \\times 10 = 10,000\\) dollars\n   - Cost of purchasing 1,000 units from the supplier: \\(1,000 \\times 1 = 1,000\\) dollars\n   - Profit from the retailer: \\(10,000 - 1,000 = 9,000\\) dollars\n\n4. **Calculate the profit for the supplier:**\n   - Revenue from selling 1,000 units to the retailer: \\(1,000 \\times 5 = 5,000\\) dollars\n   - Cost of purchasing 1,000 units from the retailer: \\(1,000 \\times 1 = 1,000\\) dollars\n   - Profit from the supplier: \\(5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000\\) dollars\n\n5. **Calculate the total profit for the supply chain:**\n   - Total profit: Profit from the retailer + Profit from the supplier = \\(9,000 + 4,000 = 13,000\\) dollars\n\nTherefore, the supply chain profits with an independent retailer are \\(\\boxed{13000}\\).",
            "To determine the supply chain profits with an independent retailer, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the optimal order quantity for the supplier:**\n   The supplier's goal is to minimize the total cost, which includes the cost of production and the cost of holding inventory. The optimal order quantity \\( Q \\) can be found using the newsv approach, which involves calculating the service level that minimizes the total cost.\n\n2. **Calculate the service level:**\n   The service level is the probability that the demand will not exceed the supply.

            "To determine the supply chain profits with an independent retailer, we need to calculate the optimal number of compact discs to supply to the retailer and then compute the resulting profits. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Determine the optimal number of compact discs to supply to the retailer:**\n   The optimal number of compact discs to supply to the retailer is the point where the expected profit is maximized. This is the point where the expected revenue from selling the discs minus the expected cost of producing them equals the expected cost of satisfying the demand.\n\n   Let \\( Q \\) be the number of compact discs supplied to the retailer. The expected revenue from selling \\( Q \\) compact discs is \\( 10 \\times \\min(Q, D) \\), where \\( D \\) is the demand, which is normally distributed with a mean of 1000 and a standard deviation of 300. The expected cost of producing \\( Q \\) compact discs is \\( Q \\times 1 \\).\n\n   The expected profit from the supply chain is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Profit} = 10 \\times \\min(Q, D) - Q\n   \\]\n\n   To find the optimal \\( Q \\), we need to find the point where the expected profit is maximized.

The optimal service level is typically found by solving the expected profit equation, but for simplicity, we can use the newspaper problem approach, which suggests that the optimal \\( Q \\) is around the mean plus a certain multiple of the standard deviation.\n\n   Using the newspaper problem approach, the optimal \\( Q \\) is approximately:\n   \\[\n   Q^* = 1000 + 1.645 \\times 300 \\approx 1493.5\n   \\]\n   Since we can't supply a fraction of a disc, we round to the nearest whole number, so \\( Q^* = 1494 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the expected profit:**\n   The expected profit can be calculated using the properties of the normal distribution. The expected revenue is the price per disc times the expected number of discs sold, which is the minimum of the number of discs produced and the demand. The expected cost is the cost per disc times the number of discs produced.\n\n   The expected number of discs sold is:\n   \\[\n   E[\\min(1494, D)] = 1000 + 0.645 \\times 300 = 1193.5\n   \\]\n   The expected revenue is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 1193.5 = 11935\n   \\]\n   The expected cost is:\n   \\[\n   1494 \\times 1 = 1494\n   \\]\n   The expected profit is:\n   \\[\n   11935 - 1494 = 10441\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the supply chain profits with an independent retailer are \\(\\boxed{10441}\\)."

            "To determine the appropriate safety stock that Marlo Stanfield's operation should hold to ensure they never run out and to keep the expected shortage per cycle at 5 phones, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time for the cell phones is three weeks.

The expected shortage is the difference between the safety stock and the mean demand during the lead time, multiplied by the probability of a shortage. The service probability \\( P \\) can be found using the inverse of the standard normal distribution. However, for simplicity, we can use the fact that the expected shortage is approximately the standard deviation of the demand during the lead time times the inverse of the service probability. For a 95% service level (which corresponds to a z-score of approximately 1.645), the expected shortage is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected shortage} = \\text{Standard deviation of demand during lead time} \\times \\text{z-score}\n   \\]\n   We need the expected shortage to be 5 phones, so we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   5 = 249.49 \\times \\text{z-score}\n   \\]\n   Solving for the z-score:\n   \\[\n   \\text{z-score} = \\frac{5}{249.49} \\approx 0.0201\n   \\]\n   However, this z-score is very small, which means we need to adjust our approach.

Since the safety stock calculated above (4505 phones) is much larger than the lot size, we need to adjust the safety stock to be a multiple of the lot size. The number of lot sizes that fit into the safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of lot sizes} = \\frac{4505}{350} \\approx 12.87\n   \\]\n   Since we can only order whole lot sizes, we round up to the next whole number, which is 13.

From standard normal distribution tables, the z-score for 0.99 is approximately 2.33.\n\n2. **Calculate the lead time demand:**\n   The lead time demand is the average demand during the lead time. The lead time is 3 weeks, and the average demand per week is 1500 phones. Therefore, the lead time demand is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ lead time demand} = 1500 \\times 3 = 4500 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the standard deviation of the lead time demand:**\n   The standard deviation of the lead time demand is the standard deviation of the weekly demand multiplied by the square root of the lead time. The standard deviation of the weekly demand is 145 phones. Therefore, the standard deviation of the lead time demand is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ standard deviation of lead time demand} = 145 \\times \\sqrt{3} \\approx 145 \\times 1.732 = 250.24 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is the z-score times the standard deviation of the lead time demand. Using the z-score of 2.33, the safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{safety stock} = 2.33 \\times 250.24 \\approx 583.23 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n   Since we need a whole number and we want to ensure the fill rate is at least 0.99, we round up to the nearest whole number:\n   \\[\n   \\text{safety stock} = 584 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the safety stock that should be held to put the fill rate at 0.99 is \\boxed{584}."
