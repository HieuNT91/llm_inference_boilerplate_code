Using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find:\n   \\[\n   P(Z > 1) = 1 - P(Z \\leq 1) \\approx 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587\n   \\]\n   So, the probability that the demand exceeds 450 pairs is approximately 0.1587.\n\n3. **Calculate the expected understock:**\n   The expected understock is the expected value of the number of pairs of skis short, given that the demand exceeds the ordered quantity. If the demand is \\(D\\) and the manager orders 450 pairs, the understock is \\(450 - D\\) when \\(D > 450\\). The expected understock can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected understock} = E[450 - D \\mid D > 450] \\cdot P(D > 450)\n   \\]\n   Since \\(D\\) is normally distributed, the expected value of \\(D\\) given that \\(D > 450\\) is:\n   \\[\n   E[D \\mid D > 450] = \\mu + \\sigma \\frac{\\phi(1)}{P(Z > 1)}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\phi(1)\\) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution at \\(z = 1\\). From the standard normal table, \\(\\phi(1) \\approx 0.24197\\), and \\(P(Z > 1) = 0.1587\\). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   E[D \\mid D > 450] = 350 + 100 \\frac{0.24197}{0.1587} \\approx 350 + 100 \\cdot 1.524 \\approx 502.4\n   \\]\n   The expected understock is then:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected understock} = (450 - 502.4) \\cdot 0.1587 \\approx -52.4 \\cdot 0.1587 \\approx 8.25\n   \\]\n   Since the expected understock cannot be negative, we conclude that the expected understock is effectively zero because the manager will not have any understock given the high probability of demand exceeding the ordered quantity.\n\nTherefore, the expected understock is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",
            "To evaluate the expected understock as a result of the manager's policy, we need to determine the probability that the demand for skis exceeds the number of pairs ordered (450 pairs), and then use this probability to find the expected understock.\n\n1. **Identify the distribution and parameters:**\n   The demand for skis is normally distributed with a mean \\(\\mu = 350\\) and a standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 100\\). We are interested in the probability that the demand \\(D\\) is greater than 450 pairs, i.e., \\(P(D > 450)\\).\n\n2. **Standardize the normal distribution:**\n   To find \\(P(D > 450)\\), we first convert the value 450 to a z-score using the formula for the z-score:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{D - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{450 - 350}{100} = 1\n   \\]\n   So, we need to find \\(P(Z > 1)\\), where \\(Z\\) is a standard normal random variable.\n\n3. **Find the probability using the standard normal distribution table:**\n   From the standard normal distribution table, we know that \\(P(Z < 1) \\approx 0.8413\\). Therefore,\n   \\[\n   P(Z > 1) = 1 - P(Z < 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587\n   \\]\n   So, the probability that the demand exceeds 450 pairs is 0.1587.\n\n4. **Calculate the expected understock:**\n   The expected understock is the number of pairs ordered multiplied by the probability that the demand exceeds the number of pairs ordered. Therefore, the expected understock is:\n   \\[\n   450 \\times 0.1587 = 71.415\n   \\]\n   Rounding to the nearest whole number, the expected understock is approximately 71 pairs.\n\nThus, the expected understock as a result of this policy is \\(\\boxed{71}\\).",

Therefore, the mean demand during the lead time (2 weeks) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mean demand during lead time} = 170 \\times 2 = 340\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is the amount of inventory that is kept to account for variability in demand during the lead time. Since the store wants to ensure there is no stockout during the lead time, the safety stock should be zero. However, in practice, a small safety stock is often added to account for random fluctuations in demand. For this problem, we will assume the safety stock is zero for simplicity.\n\n3. **Calculate the re order point:**\n   The re order point is the sum of the mean demand during the lead time and the safety stock:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Re order point} = \\text{Mean demand during lead time} + \\text{Safety stock} = 340 + 0 = 340\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the service level:**\n   The store reorders when the inventory drops below 400. Since the re order point is 340, the inventory will drop below 400 when the demand during the lead time exceeds 60 (400 - 340). This means the store is ensuring that the inventory will not drop below 400 even if the demand during the lead time is at its mean value of 340, because the safety stock is zero.\n\n5. **Determine the cycle time:**\n   The cycle time is the time between reorders. Since the store reorders when the inventory drops below 400 and the lead time is 2 weeks, the cycle time is 2 weeks.\n\nTherefore, the store achieves a service level of ensuring that the inventory will not drop below 400 even if the demand during the lead time is at its mean value of 340.

The store manager reorders when the inventory drops below 400 jeans, which means the store needs to have enough jeans to meet the demand for the next two weeks. Therefore, we need to find the probability that the total demand for the next two weeks exceeds 400 jeans.\n\nThe total demand for two weeks is also normally distributed with a mean of \\(2 \\times 170 = 340\\) and a standard deviation of \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times 85 \\approx 120.21\\). We need to find the probability that the total demand for two weeks is greater than 400 jeans.

This means that there is a 99.66% chance that the weekly demand will be less than or equal to 400 jeans. Therefore, there is a 0.34% chance that the weekly demand will be greater than 400 jeans.\n\nSince the store needs to restock twice a year, we need to find the probability that the store will need to restock more than twice a year. This is the probability that the weekly demand will be greater than 400 jeans more than once in a year. The probability of this happening can be calculated using the binomial distribution, but a simpler approach is to use the Poisson approximation for large n and small p.\n\nThe Poisson parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = n \\cdot p = 52 \\cdot 0.0034 = 0.1768\n\\]\n\nThe probability of having to restock more than twice a year is the probability of having to restock zero times or once, since the probability of having to restock more than twice is very small. The probability of having to restock zero times is:\n\n\\[\nP(X = 0) = e^{-\\lambda} = e^{-0.1768} \\approx 0.838\n\\]\n\nThe probability of having to restock once is:\n\n\\[\nP(X = 1) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda} = 0.1768 \\cdot e^{-0.1768} \\approx 0.151\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of having to restock more than twice a year is:\n\n\\[\nP(X \\geq 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) = 1 - 0.838 - 0.151 = 0.011\n\\]\n\nThus, the store achieves a frequency of restocking more than twice a year, which is a 1.1% chance. Therefore, the store achieves restocking more than twice a year.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{2}",
            "To determine what else the store achieves, we need to understand the inventory system and the probability of stockouts. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - The weekly demand for jeans is normally distributed with a mean of 170 and a standard deviation of 85.\n   - The store has a lead time of 2 weeks for the jeans to be delivered.\n   - The store re orders jeans when the inventory drops below 400.\n\n2. **Calculating the Total demand during the lead time:**\n   - The total demand during the lead time (2 weeks) is the sum of two normally distributed random variables, each with mean 170 and standard deviation 85.\n   - The mean of the total demand during the lead time is \\(2 \\times 170 = 340\\).\n   - The standard deviation of the total demand during the lead time is \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times 85 \\approx 120.21\\).\n\n3. **Determining the Probability of Stockout:**\n   - The store reorders when the inventory drops below 400. This means the store will have a stockout if the total demand during the lead time exceeds \\(400 - 400 = 0\\).\n   - We need to find the probability that the total demand is less than or equal to 400.\n   - We standardize the total demand to a standard normal variable \\(Z\\):\n     \\[\n     Z = \\frac{400 - 340}{120.21} \\approx 0.5\n     \\]\n   - Using the standard normal distribution table, the probability that \\(Z \\leq 0.5\\) is approximately 0.6915.\n\n4. **Calculating the Probability of No Stockout:**\n   - The probability of no stockout is the probability that the total demand is less than or equal to 400, which is 0.6915.\n\n5. **Calculating the Probability of Stockout:**\n   - The probability of a stockout is the complement of the probability of no stockout:\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{stockout}) = 1 - 0.6915 = 0.3085\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The store achieves a service level of 69.15% (or 0.6915 probability of no stockout) and a probability of stockout of 30.85%.\n\nTherefore, the store achieves a service level of \\(\\boxed{69.15\\%}\\).",
            "To determine the frequency at which the store needs to place reorders, we need to calculate the probability that the weekly demand for jeans will exceed the maximum inventory level that can be maintained without a repeat order. Specifically, we need to find the probability that the weekly demand will be more than 400 jeans.\n\nThe weekly demand for jeans is normally distributed with a mean of 170 and a standard deviation of 85. We can standardize the variable using the formula for the z-score:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\( X = 400 \\), \\( \\mu = 170 \\), and \\( \\sigma = 85 \\). Plugging in these values, we get:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{400 - 170}{85} = \\frac{230}{85} \\approx 2.71 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that a standard normal variable is greater than 2.71. This is equivalent to finding \\( P(Z > 2.71) \\). Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that:\n\n\\[ P(Z < 2.71) \\approx 0.9966 \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ P(Z > 2.71) = 1 - P(Z < 2.71) = 1 - 0.9966 = 0.0034 \\]\n\nThis means that there is a 0.34% chance that the weekly demand for jeans will exceed 400 jeans, which will require a repeat order. Since the store needs to place a reorder when the inventory drops below 400 jeans, the store will need to place a reorder every \\( \\frac{1}{0.0034} \\) weeks, which is approximately 294.12 weeks. Since the store can only place one order per week, the store will need to place a reorder approximately every 294 weeks.\n\nThus, the store achieves \\(\\boxed{294}\\) weeks.",
            "To determine the lead time required for the store to achieve its service level, we need to calculate the probability that the weekly demand for jeans will not exceed the re order point (which is the inventory level when a new order is placed) before the inventory drops below 400.\n\nThe lead time is the time between placing an order and receiving it. In this case, the lead time is the time it takes for the supply plant to supply the jeans, which is 2 weeks. The store manager monitor its inventory continuously and reorders jeans when the available inventory drops below 400. Therefore, the store needs to ensure that the inventory level is sufficient to cover the demand for the lead time plus a safety stock to account for variability in the demand.\n\nGiven:\n- Weekly demand for jeans is normally distributed with a mean of 170 and a standard deviation of 85.\n- The store reorders when the inventory drops below 400.\n- The lead time is 2 weeks.\n\nFirst, we calculate the expected demand over the lead time (2 weeks):\n\\[ \\text{Expected demand over 2 weeks} = 2 \\times 170 = 340 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the safety stock required to ensure the inventory does not drop below 400. The safety stock is the difference between the safety stock point and the expected demand over the lead time. The safety stock point is the inventory level at which a new order is placed, which is 400. Therefore, the safety stock is:\n\\[ \\text{ safety stock} = 400 - 340 = 60 \\]\n\nThe safety stock can also be calculated using the standard deviation of the demand. The safety stock required to achieve a certain service level is given by the product of the standard deviation of the demand and the appropriate z-score corresponding to the service level. However, since the problem does not specify a service level, we can assume that the safety stock of 60 is sufficient to cover the variability in the demand over the lead time.\n\nTherefore, the store achieves a lead time of 2 weeks to ensure that the inventory does not drop below the re order point before the inventory drops below 400.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",
            "To determine how often the store needs to place a new order, we need to calculate the probability that the weekly demand for jeans exceeds the supply of 400 jeans, given that the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 170 and a standard deviation of 85.\n\nFirst, we calculate the z-score for the critical value of 400 jeans. The z-score is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) is the critical value (400), \\( \\mu \\) is the mean (170), and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation (85). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{400 - 170}{85} = \\frac{230}{85} \\approx 2.71 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that the weekly demand exceeds 400 jeans. This is equivalent to finding the area under the standard normal curve to the right of \\( z = 2.71 \\). Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the area to the left of \\( z = 2.71 \\) is approximately 0.9966. Therefore, the area to the right of \\( z = 2.71 \\) is:\n\n\\[ 1 - 0.9966 = 0.0034 \\]\n\nThis means that there is a 0.34% chance that the weekly demand for jeans will exceed 400 jeans. Since the store needs to place a new order when the inventory drops below 400 jeans, the probability that the store will need to place a new order in any given week is 0.34%.\n\nTo find out how often the store needs to place a new order, we take the reciprocal of this probability:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{0.0034} \\approx 294.12 \\]\n\nSince the store cannot place an order in a fraction of a week, we round this to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the store needs to place a new order approximately every 294 weeks.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{294}\n\\]",
            "To determine what day the store achieves its service level, we need to understand the point at which the inventory drops below 400 and the probability that this event occurs. We'll use the properties of the normal distribution to find this probability and then interpret it in terms of the service level achieved.\n\n1. **Identify the distribution parameters and the lead time:**\n   - Weekly demand for jeans is normally distributed with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 170 and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 85.\n   - The store orders jeans when the inventory drops below 400, and it takes 2 weeks to receive the order.\n\n2. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   - The lead time is 2 weeks, so the total demand during this period is normally distributed with a mean of \\(2 \\times 170 = 340\\) and a standard deviation of \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times 85 \\approx 120.21\\).\n\n3. **Determine the inventory level when the order is placed:**\n   - The store places an order when the inventory drops to 400. Therefore, the inventory level just before the order is placed is 400.\n\n4. **Calculate the probability that the inventory drops below 400:**\n   - We need to find the probability that the total demand during the lead time exceeds 400. This is equivalent to finding the probability that a normally distributed random variable with mean 340 and standard deviation 120.21 is greater than 400.\n   - First, we standardize the value 400:\n     \\[\n     Z = \\frac{400 - 340}{120.21} \\approx 0.50\n     \\]\n   - Using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the probability that a standard normal variable is less than 0.50 is approximately 0.6915. Therefore, the probability that the total demand is greater than 400 is:\n     \\[\n     P(Z > 0.50) = 1 - 0.6915 = 0.3085\n     \\]\n   - This means there is a 30.85% chance that the inventory will drop below 400 before the order arrives.\n\n5. **Interpret the service level:**\n   - The store achieves a service level of 99.15% because the probability of the inventory dropping below 400 is 0.3085, which means the store will have enough inventory to meet demand 99.15% of the time.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{99.15\\%}\n\\]"
