The marginal production cost for the confectioner is \u20ac2.50 per cake. At M&S, the cakes are priced at \u20ac29 and the expected demand over the next two months to be normally distributed, with a mean of 8,000 and a standard deviation of 2,000. M&S places a single order with the confectioner for delivery at the beginning of the two-month period. Currently, M&S discounts any unsold cakes at the end of two months down to \u20ac5, and any cakes that did not sell at full price sell at this price. A plan under discussion is for the confectioner to refund M&S \u20ac7 per cake that does not sell during the two-month period. As before, M&S will discount them to \u20ac5 and sell any that remain. Under this plan, what is the expected profit for M&S under its optimal actions?\nassistant\n",

            "To determine the expected profit for M means under the optimal actions, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the critical ratio**:\n   The critical ratio is the probability that a cake will be sold at the full price. It is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Critical Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Selling Price} - Marginal Cost}{Selling Price - Refund}\n   \\]\n   Here, the selling price is \u20ac29, the marginal cost is \u20ac2.50, and the refund is \u20ac7. Plugging in these values, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Critical Ratio} = \\frac{29 - 2.50}{29 - 7} = \\frac{26.50}{22} \\approx 1.195\n   \\]\n   However, this critical ratio is not valid because it exceeds 1. This indicates that the refund is more than the profit from selling the cake at full price. In such cases, the confectioner should sell all the cakes at the full price unless the demand is very low, which is not the case here. Therefore, the confectioner should sell all the cakes at the full price.\n\n2. **Calculate the expected demand**:\n   The expected demand is given as a normally distributed random variable with a mean of 8,000 and a standard deviation of 2,000. Since the confectioner will sell all the cakes at the full price, the expected profit is simply the expected demand multiplied by the profit per cake.\n\n3. **Calculate the profit per cake**:\n   The profit per cake is the selling price minus the marginal cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit per cake} = 29 - 2.50 = 26.50\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the expected profit**:\n   The expected profit is the expected demand multiplied by the profit per cake:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Profit} = 8000 \\times 26.50 = 212000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected profit for M means under its optimal actions is \\(\\boxed{212000}\\).",
            "To determine the expected profit for M means under the optimal actions, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the variables and parameters:**\n   - Selling price per cake: \u20ac15\n   - Marginal production cost per cake: \u20ac2.50\n   - Discounted price per cake at the end of two months: \u20ac5\n   - Refund per cake if not sold: \u20ac7\n   - Expected demand: Normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 8000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 2000 \\)\n\n2. **Determine the optimal production quantity:**\n   The optimal production quantity \\( Q \\) is the quantity that maximizes the expected profit. This quantity is given by the critical ratio formula:\n   \\[\n   Q = \\mu + z \\sigma\n   \\]\n   where \\( z \\) is the standard normal variable corresponding to the critical ratio. The critical ratio \\( F \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F = \\frac{P - C}{P - R}\n   \\]\n   where \\( P \\) is the selling price, \\( C \\) is the production cost, and \\( R \\) is the refund price. Plugging in the values, we get:\n   \\[\n   F = \\frac{15 - 2.50}{15 - 7} = \\frac{12.50}{8} = 1.5625\n   \\]\n   However, since the critical ratio cannot be greater than 1, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution to find the optimal production quantity. The optimal production quantity \\( Q \\) is the value such that the probability of meeting the demand is 0.99 (since the expected demand is 8000 and the standard deviation is 2000, we need to find the z-score corresponding to the 99th percentile of the standard normal distribution, which is approximately 2.326). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   Q = 8000 + 2.326 \\times 2000 = 12652\n   \\]\n   Since the optimal production quantity is 12652, which is much higher than the expected demand of 8000, we will use the expected demand as the production quantity.\n\n3. **Calculate the expected profit:**\n   The expected profit is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit} = \\text{Expected revenue} - \\text{Expected cost}\n   \\]\n   The expected revenue is the revenue from selling the expected demand at the full price:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected revenue} = 8000 \\times 15 = 120000\n   \\]\n   The expected cost is the production cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected cost} = 8000 \\times 2.50 = 20000\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the expected profit is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit} = 120000 - 20000 = 100000\n   \\]\n\nThus, the expected profit for M means under its optimal actions is \\(\\boxed{100000}\\).",
            "To determine the expected profit for M means under the optimal actions, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the optimal order quantity:**\n   The optimal order quantity is the quantity that maximizes expected profit. This quantity is given by the critical ratio formula:\n   \\[\n   Q^* = \\mu + z \\sigma\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean demand, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of demand, and \\(z\\) is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the critical ratio \\(F^{-1}(p - c)\\), where \\(p\\) is the price per cake, \\(c\\) is the cost per cake, and \\(F^{-1}\\) is the inverse cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n\n   Here, \\(p = 29\\), \\(c = 2.50\\), and the cost of overage is \\(p - 5 = 24\\) and the cost of shortage is \\(5 - 2.50 = 2.50\\). The critical ratio is:\n   \\[\n   F^{-1}\\left(\\frac{24}{24 + 2.50}\\right) = F^{-1}(0.9138)\n   \\]\n   From the standard normal distribution table, \\(F^{-1}(0.9138) \\approx 1.34\\). Therefore, the optimal order quantity is:\n   \\[\n   Q^* = 8000 + 1.34 \\times 2000 = 10680\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the expected profit:**\n   The expected profit is the expected revenue minus the expected cost. The expected revenue is the price per cake times the expected number of cakes sold, and the expected cost is the cost per cake times the expected number of cakes ordered.\n\n   The expected number of cakes sold is the minimum of the optimal order quantity and the demand. Since the demand is normally distributed with mean 8000 and standard deviation 2000, we need to find the expected value of the minimum of 10680 and the demand.\n\n   The expected value of the minimum of a constant \\(Q\\) and a normally distributed random variable \\(D\\) with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is:\n   \\[\n   E[\\min(Q, D)] = \\mu + \\sigma \\left(\\frac{\\phi(z)}{1 - \\Phi(z)}\\right)\n   \\]\n   where \\(z = \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\), \\(\\phi\\) is the standard normal density function, and \\(\\Phi\\) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.\n\n   Here, \\(Q = 10680\\), \\(\\mu = 8000\\), and \\(\\sigma = 2000\\). So,\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{10680 - 8000}{2000} = 1.34\n   \\]\n   Using the standard normal distribution table, \\(\\phi(1.34) \\approx 0.164\\), and \\(\\Phi(1.34) \\approx 0.91\\). Therefore,\n   \\[\n   E[\\min(10680, D)] = 8000 + 2000 \\left(\\frac{0.164}{1 - 0.91}\\right) = 8000 + 2000 \\times 1.64 = 9280\n   \\]\n   The expected revenue is:\n   \\[\n   29 \\times 9280 = 271120\n   \\]\n   The expected cost is:\n   \\[\n   2.50 \\times 10680 = 26700\n   \\]\n   The expected profit is:\n   \\[\n   271120 - 26700 = 244420\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected profit for M means under its optimal actions is \\(\\boxed{244420}\\).",

The sponsor is independently wealthy, so he donates his time and materials to the fundraising effort. Club officers set up a card table in the atrium of the business building and take turns staffing it for the duration of the barbecue season, which is four months. Eighteen sad years of experience have revealed that demand varies depending on the month of the season. Customer demand in the first month can be described as $400-p_1$, in the second month as $400-1.4\\times p_2$, in the third month $400-1.8\\times p_3$, and in the fourth month $400-2.2\\times p_4$. The club sponsor has only 400 spare mason jars this year after a busy summer collecting specimens. What should the price be in period 1?\nassistant\n",

A reasonable assumption is that the prices in periods 2, 3, and 4 are set such that the revenue from each month is maximized under the constraint that the total number of jars sold is 400. This implies that the prices in periods 2, 3, and 4 are set to zero (i.e., free), and the entire 400 jars are sold in period 1.\n\nThus, we have:\n\\[ p_1 + 1.4 \\cdot 0 + 1.8 \\cdot 0 + 2.2 \\cdot 0 = 1200 \\]\n\\[ p_1 = 1200 \\]\n\nHowever, this is not a practical solution because it would mean that the club is selling jars at a price that exceeds the demand in period 1. Instead, we need to find a more realistic solution where the prices in periods 2, 3, and 4 are not zero but still maximize the revenue under the constraint.\n\nTo find a more practical solution, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or numerical optimization techniques.

Club officers set up a card table in the atrium of the business building and take turns staffing it for the duration of the barbecue season, which is four months. Eighteen sad years of experience have revealed that demand varies depending on the month of the season. Customer demand in the first month can be described as $400-p_1$, in the second month as $400-1.4\\times p_2$, in the third month $400-1.8\\times p_3$, and in the fourth month $400-2.2\\times p_4$.

Club officers set up a card table in the atrium of the business building and take turns staffing it for the duration of the computer clock season, which is four months. Twenty-five years of experience have revealed that demand varies depending on the month of the season. Customer demand in the first month can be described as $20-p_1$, in the second month as $20-1.4\\times p_2$, in the third month $20-1.8\\times p_3$, and in the fourth month $20-2.2\\times p_4$.

The cost per clock is $0.25, and the revenue per clock depends on the demand for each month.\n\nThe demand for clocks in each month is given by:\n- First month: \\(20 - p_1\\)\n- Second month: \\(20 - 1.4 \\times p_2\\)\n- Third month: \\(20 - 1.8 \\times p_3\\)\n- Fourth month: \\(20 - 2.2 \\times p_4\\)\n\nThe profit for each month is the demand for that month multiplied by the price per clock minus the cost per clock.

However, since the problem does not specify the relationship between the prices and the production capacity, we assume that the club can produce any number of clocks they sell. Therefore, the club should produce the maximum number of clocks they can sell, which is the maximum demand across all months.\n\nThe maximum demand is the highest value among the demands in each month. The demands are:\n- First month: \\(20 - p_1\\)\n- Second month: \\(20 - 1.4 \\times p_2\\)\n- Third month: \\(20 - 1.8 \\times p_3\\)\n- Fourth month: \\(20 - 2.2 \\times p_4\\)\n\nSince the problem does not specify the prices \\(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\\), we assume the club will set prices to maximize the total demand. The maximum demand is achieved when the prices are set such that the demand in each month is maximized. The maximum demand is the highest value among the demands, which is 20 (when the price is set to 0).\n\nTherefore, the club should produce the maximum number of clocks they can sell, which is 20 clocks per month. The total number of clocks produced over the four months is:\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 4 = 80 \\]\n\nThus, the club should produce \\(\\boxed{80}\\) clocks.",

The marginal production cost for the confectioner is \u20ac2.50 per cake. At M&S, the cakes are priced at \u20ac29 and the expected demand over the next two months to be normally distributed, with a mean of 8,000 and a standard deviation of 2,000. M&S places a single order with the confectioner for delivery at the beginning of the two-month period. Currently, M&S discounts any unsold cakes at the end of two months down to \u20ac5, and any cakes that did not sell at full price sell at this price. A plan under discussion is for the confectioner to refund M&S \u20ac7 per cake that does not sell during the two-month period. As before, M&S will discount them to \u20ac5 and sell any that remain. Under this plan, what is the expected profit for the confectioner under the optimal action of M&S?\nassistant\n",

The profit from each cake sold at full price is \u20ac15 - \u20ac2.50 = \u20ac12.50. The loss from each cake not sold is \u20ac2.50 (marginal cost) + \u20ac5 (discount price) - \u20ac15 (full price) = \u20ac-7.50 (a loss).\n\nThe expected profit is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Expected Profit} = \\text{Profit from sold cakes} - \\text{Loss from unsold cakes} \\]\n\nThe number of cakes sold at full price is the demand, which is normally distributed with a mean of 8,000 and a standard deviation of 2,000.

            "To determine the expected profit for the confectioner under the optimal action of M means, we need to analyze the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables and the cost structure:\n- Price per cake when sold at full price: \u20ac29\n- Marginal production cost per cake: \u20ac2.50\n- Discounted price per cake at the end of two months: \u20ac5\n- Refund per cake that does not sell: \u20ac7\n- Cost per cake if not sold at full price: \u20ac2.50 + \u20ac7 = \u20ac9.50\n\nThe confectioner's profit from selling a cake at full price is:\n\\[ 29 - 2.50 = 26.50 \\text{ euros} \\]\n\nThe confectioner's profit from selling a cake at the discounted price is:\n\\[ 5 - 2.50 = 2.50 \\text{ euros} \\]\n\nThe confectioner's refund profit for each unsold cake is:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ euros} \\]\n\nThe expected demand is normally distributed with a mean of 8,000 and a standard deviation of 2,000. The optimal action for the confectioner is to produce the quantity that maximizes the expected profit. This quantity is the critical point of the demand distribution, which is typically the mean in a normal distribution. However, we need to check if producing more than the mean would be beneficial.\n\nLet's calculate the expected profit for producing 8,000 cakes:\n- If all 8,000 cakes are sold at full price, the profit is:\n\\[ 8000 \\times 26.50 = 212000 \\text{ euros} \\]\n- If some cakes are not sold, the profit is reduced by the cost of the unsold cakes and the refund profit.\n\nSince the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 8,000, the expected profit from producing 8,000 cakes is the highest possible profit because producing more than 8,000 cakes would only reduce the profit due to the cost of unsold cakes and the refund profit.\n\nTherefore, the expected profit for the confectioner is:\n\\[ \\boxed{212000} \\]"

The sponsor is independently wealthy, so he donates his time and materials to the fundraising effort. Club officers set up a card table in the atrium of the business building and take turns staffing it for the duration of the barbecue season, which is four months. Eighteen sad years of experience have revealed that demand varies depending on the month of the season. Customer demand in the first month can be described as $400-p_1$, in the second month as $400-1.4\\times p_2$, in the third month $400-1.8\\times p_3$, and in the fourth month $400-2.2\\times p_4$. The club sponsor has only 400 spare mason jars this year after a busy summer collecting specimens. What is the expected revenue if the student APICS chapter uses dynamic pricing?\nassistant\n",

            "To determine the expected revenue using dynamic pricing, we need to maximize the total revenue from selling the mason jars over the four months. The revenue for each month is given by the demand function multiplied by the price per jar, and the total revenue is the sum of the revenues from each month.\n\nLet's denote the price per jar in each month as \\( p_1, p_2, p_3, \\) and \\( p_4 \\) respectively. The demand functions are:\n- First month: \\( 400 - p_1 \\)\n- Second month: \\( 400 - 1.4p_2 \\)\n- Third month: \\( 400 - 1.8p_3 \\)\n- Fourth month: \\( 400 - 2.2p_4 \\)\n\nThe total revenue \\( R \\) is the sum of the revenues from each month:\n\\[ R = p_1 (400 - p_1) + p_2 (400 - 1.4p_2) + p_3 (400 - 1.8p_3) + p_4 (400 - 2.2p_4) \\]\n\nTo maximize the total revenue, we need to find the optimal prices \\( p_1, p_2, p_3, \\) and \\( p_4 \\) under the constraint that the total number of jars sold cannot exceed 400. The total number of jars sold is:\n\\[ (400 - p_1) + (400 - 1.4p_2) + (400 - 1.8p_3) + (400 - 2.2p_4) \\leq 400 \\]\n\\[ 1600 - (p_1 + 1.4p_2 + 1.8p_3 + 2.2p_4) \\leq 400 \\]\n\\[ p_1 + 1.4p_2 + 1.8p_3 + 2.2p_4 \\geq 1200 \\]\n\nTo find the optimal prices, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or simply reason through the problem. Since the demand functions are linear and the constraint is also linear, the optimal solution will occur at the boundary of the feasible region. We can start by assuming that the prices are such that the total number of jars sold is exactly 400, and then we can solve for the prices.\n\nLet's assume that the prices are such that the total number of jars sold is exactly 400. We can start by setting \\( p_1 = 200 \\), \\( p_2 = 150 \\), \\( p_3 = 150 \\), and \\( p_4 = 150 \\). Then the total number of jars sold is:\n\\[ (400 - 200) + (400 - 1.4 \\times 150) + (400 - 1.8 \\times 150) + (400 - 2.2 \\times 150) = 200 + 170 + 130 + 130 = 630 \\]\nThis exceeds 400, so we need to adjust the prices. Let's try \\( p_1 = 200 \\), \\( p_2 = 150 \\), \\( p_3 = 150 \\), and \\( p_4 = 100 \\). Then the total number of jars sold is:\n\\[ (400 - 200) + (400 - 1.4 \\times 150) + (400 - 1.8 \\times 150) + (400 - 2.2 \\times 100) = 200 + 170 + 130 + 180 = 680 \\]\nThis also exceeds 400, so we need to adjust the prices further. Let's try \\( p_1 = 200 \\), \\( p_2 = 150 \\), \\( p_3 = 150 \\), and \\( p_4 = 100 \\) again, but this time we will adjust the prices to satisfy the constraint.

The total quantity sold is:\n\\[ (400 - p_1) + (400 - 1.4p_2) + (400 - 1.8p_3) + (400 - 2.2p_4) = 1600 - (p_1 + 1.4p_2 + 1.8p_3 + 2.2p_4) \\]\n\nSince the club sponsor has only 400 spare mason jars, we have the constraint:\n\\[ 1600 - (p_1 + 1.4p_2 + 1.8p_3 + 2.2p_4) = 400 \\]\n\\[ p_1 + 1.4p_2 + 1.8p_3 + 2.2p_4 = 1200 \\]\n\nTo maximize the revenue, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or trial and error to find the optimal prices. However, a simpler approach is to assume that the prices are set such that the quantity sold in each month is maximized while still satisfying the total quantity constraint. A reasonable assumption is to set the prices such that the quantity sold in each month is proportional to the coefficient of the price in the demand function.\n\nLet's assume:\n\\[ p_1 = 200, \\quad p_2 = 150, \\quad p_3 = 150, \\quad p_4 = 150 \\]\n\nThen the quantity sold in each month is:\n- First month: \\( 400 - 200 = 200 \\)\n- Second month: \\( 400 - 1.4 \\times 150 = 400 - 210 = 190 \\)\n- Third month: \\( 400 - 1.8 \\times 150 = 400 - 270 = 130 \\)\n- Fourth month: \\( 400 - 2.2 \\times 150 = 400 - 330 = 70 \\)\n\nThe total quantity sold is:\n\\[ 200 + 190 + 130 + 70 = 600 \\]\n\nSince the total quantity sold exceeds 400, we need to adjust the prices. Let's try:\n\\[ p_1 = 200, \\quad p_2 = 150, \\quad p_3 = 150, \\quad p_4 = 100 \\]\n\nThen the quantity sold in each month is:\n- First month: \\( 400 - 200 = 200 \\)\n- Second month: \\( 400 - 1.4 \\times 150 = 400 - 210 = 190 \\)\n- Third month: \\( 400 - 1.8 \\times 150 = 400 - 270 = 130 \\)\n- Fourth month: \\( 400 - 2.2 \\times 100 = 400 - 220 = 180 \\)\n\nThe total quantity sold is:\n\\[ 200 + 190 + 130 + 180 = 700 \\]\n\nWe need to adjust the prices further. Let's try:\n\\[ p_1 = 200, \\quad p_2 = 150, \\quad p_3 = 150, \\quad p_4 = 100 \\]\n\nThen the quantity sold in each month is:\n- First month: \\( 400 - 200 = 200 \\)\n- Second month: \\( 400 - 1.4 \\times 150 = 400 - 210 = 190 \\)\n- Third month: \\( 400 - 1.8 \\times 150 = 400 - 270 = 130 \\)\n- Fourth month: \\( 400 - 2.2 \\times 100 = 400 - 220 = 180 \\)\n\nThe total quantity sold is:\n\\[ 200 + 190 + 130 + 180 = 700 \\]\n\nThe expected revenue is:\n\\[ R = 200 \\times 200 + 150 \\times 190 + 150 \\times 130 + 100 \\times 180 = 40000 + 28500 + 19500 + 18000 = 106000 \\]\n\nThe expected revenue is:\n\\[ \\boxed{106000} \\]",
            "To determine the expected revenue from the pint mason jars sold during the four-month barbe)--on season, we need to calculate the revenue for each month based on the demand function and the constraint of the number of mason jars available. The demand functions are given as follows:\n\n- First month: \\(400 - p_1\\)\n- Second month: \\(400 - 1.4p_2\\)\n- Third month: \\(400 - 1.8p_3\\)\n- Fourth month: \\(400 - 2.2p_4\\)\n\nThe club has a total of 400 mason jars available over the four months. We will use dynamic pricing to maximize revenue. Let's denote the price per jar sold in the \\(i\\)-th month as \\(p_i\\). The revenue for each month can be calculated as the price per jar multiplied by the number of jars sold in that month. The number of jars sold in each month is the minimum of the demand and the remaining jars. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the optimal prices.\n\n1. **First Month:**\n   - The demand is \\(400 - p_1\\).\n   - The revenue is \\(p_1 \\times \\min(400 - p_1, 400)\\).\n   - Since the maximum demand is 400 jars, we set \\(p_1 = 0\\) to maximize revenue from the first month. The revenue from the first month is \\(0 \\times 400 = 0\\).\n\n2. **Second Month:**\n   - The demand is \\(400 - 1.4p_2\\).\n   - The revenue is \\(p_2 \\times \\min(400 - 1.4p_2, 400)\\).\n   - To maximize revenue, we set \\(p_2 = 0\\) again. The revenue from the second month is \\(0 \\times 400 = 0\\).\n\n3. **Third Month:**\n   - The demand is \\(400 - 1.8p_3\\).\n   - The revenue is \\(p_3 \\times \\min(400 - 1.8p_3, 400)\\).\n   - To maximize revenue, we set \\(p_3 = 0\\) again. The revenue from the third month is \\(0 \\times 400 = 0\\).\n\n4. **Fourth Month:**\n   - The demand is \\(400 - 2.2p_4\\).\n   - The revenue is \\(p_4 \\times \\min(400 - 2.2p_4, 400)\\).\n   - To maximize revenue, we set \\(p_4 = 0\\) again. The revenue from the fourth month is \\(0 \\times 400 = 0\\).\n\nHowever, this approach does not consider the constraint of the total number of jars. Instead, we need to find the optimal prices that maximize the total revenue while satisfying the constraint. We will use a more practical approach by setting the prices such that the total number of jars sold is 400.\n\nLet's assume we set the prices such that the total number of jars sold is 400. We can set the prices as follows:\n- \\(p_1 = 200\\), so the demand is \\(400 - 200 = 200\\) jars.\n- \\(p_2 = 200\\), so the demand is \\(400 - 1.4 \\times 200 = 120\\) jars.\n- \\(p_3 = 200\\), so the demand is \\(400 - 1.8 \\times 200 = 80\\) jars.\n- \\(p_4 = 200\\), so the demand is \\(400 - 2.2 \\times 200 = 40\\) jars.\n\nThe total number of jars sold is \\(200 + 120 + 80 + 40 = 440\\), which exceeds the available 400 jars. Therefore, we need to adjust the prices. Let's set the prices such that the total number of jars sold is 400. We can set the prices as follows:\n- \\(p_1 = 100\\), so the demand is \\(400 - 100 = 300\\) jars.\n- \\(p_2 = 100\\), so the demand is \\(400 - 1.4 \\times 100 = 260\\) jars.\n- \\(p_3 = 100\\), so the demand is \\(400 - 1.8 \\times 100 = 220\\) jars.\n- \\(p_4 = 100\\), so the demand is \\(400 - 2.2 \\times 100 = 180\\) jars.\n\nThe total number of jars sold is \\(300 + 260 + 220 + 180 = 960\\), which exceeds the available 400 jars.

The company sells four designs namely; engagement, wedding, anniversaries, and birthdays, and currently all packaging is designed and made in the plant as the frames are manufactured. As the frames are manufacturing they are packaged. The demand forecast for each of the four boxes is normally distributed, with a mean of 26,000 and a standard deviation of 9,000. Each box costs \u20ac4 and is sold for \u20ac6. Any unsold boxes at the end of the year are discounted \u20ac3, and they all sell out at this price. The cost of holding a box in inventory for the entire year before selling it at a discount is \u20ac0.50. An option being considered by Frame It is to separate frame manufacture from packaging.

Since the expected profit in the current scenario is twice that of the proposed scenario, it is clear that the current scenario is more profitable.\n\nTherefore, the number of frames that Frame It should manufacture if it decides to move packaging to an express line is the same as the current production quantity.

However, there is an additional cost of \u20ac1 per frame for separate manufacture.\n\n1. **Selling Price per Box**: \u20ac6\n2. **Cost per Box**: \u20ac4 + \u20ac1 = \u20ac5\n3. **Discounted Price per Box**: \u20ac3\n4. **Holding Cost per Box**: \u20ac0.50\n5. **Mean demand per Box**: 26,000\n6. **Standard Deviation of demand per Box**: 9,000\n\nThe expected profit per box is:\n- If a box is sold, the profit is \u20ac6 - \u20ac5 = \u20ac1.\n- If a box is not sold, it is sold at a discount of \u20ac3, so the loss is \u20ac5 - \u20ac3 = \u20ac2.\n- The holding cost for each box is \u20ac0.50.\n\nThe expected profit per box, considering the probability of selling and not selling, is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected Profit per Box} = (0.5 \\times 1) + (0.5 \\times -2) - 0.5 = 0.5 - 1 - 0.5 = -1 \\]\n\nSince the expected profit per box is negative, the total expected profit for a large number of boxes will be negative.

Clearly, the proposed scenario is cheaper.\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of frames that Frame It should manufacture if it decides to move packaging to an express line is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{40805}\n\\]",

            "To determine the optimal order size if LTL shipping is used, we need to consider both the cost of transportation and the holding cost. The goal is to minimize the total cost, which includes the cost of transportation, the cost of holding inventory, and the cost of placing orders.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost for LTL shipping. The cost per unit is \\$1, and each truck can carry up to 2,000 units. Since the annual demand from each supplier is 3,000 units, SuperPart will need to order from at least two suppliers to meet the demand. Let's consider the case where SuperPart orders from exactly two suppliers.\n\nThe cost of transportation for two suppliers is:\n\\[ 2 \\times \\$1,150 = \\$2,300 \\]\n\nThe cost of holding inventory is calculated using the formula for the average inventory level, which is half of the order quantity. Since the annual demand is 3,000 units from each supplier, the average inventory level for each supplier is 1,500 units. Therefore, the total holding cost is:\n\\[ 1,500 \\times 2 \\times \\$50 \\times 0.23 = \\$3,450 \\]\n\nThe cost of placing orders is \\$450 per order. Since SuperPart orders from two suppliers, the total ordering cost is:\n\\[ 2 \\times \\$150 = \\$300 \\]\n\nAdding these costs together, the total cost for LTL shipping is:\n\\[ \\$2,300 + \\$3,450 + \\$300 = \\$6,050 \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the case where SuperPart orders from three suppliers. The cost of transportation for three suppliers is:\n\\[ 3 \\times \\$1,150 = \\$3,450 \\]\n\nThe cost of holding inventory is:\n\\[ 1,500 \\times 3 \\times \\$50 \\times 0.23 = \\$5,550 \\]\n\nThe cost of placing orders is:\n\\[ 3 \\times \\$150 = \\$450 \\]\n\nAdding these costs together, the total cost for LQR shipping is:\n\\[ \\$3,450 + \\$5,550 + \\$450 = \\$9,450 \\]\n\nComparing the two total costs, we see that the total cost for LQR shipping is lower than the total cost for LTL shipping. Therefore, the optimal order size if LQR shipping is used is the same as the optimal order size for LQR shipping, which is the cost of ordering from three suppliers.\n\nThe optimal order size is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3000} \\]"

The current policy is to carry every drug in each retail outlet. DoorRed is investigating the possibility of centralizing some of the drugs in one location. Delivery charge would increase by $0.02 per unit if a drug were centralized. The increase in delivery charge comes from the additional cost of operating the shuttle from the central location to each of the other locations. At each retail outlet, DoorRed follows a periodic review policy with weekly replenishment (a replenishment order is placed once every seven days). The replenishment lead time is three days. DoorRed plans to stick to once- a-week ordering even if a drug is centralized. DoorRed incurs an annual inventory holding cost of 20 percent and aims for a cycle service level of 99 percent.

            "To determine the optimal order size when using LTL shipping with a separate truck for each supplier, we need to calculate the total cost for different order sizes and find the one that minimizes the total cost. The total cost includes the shipping cost, the cost of the units, the ordering cost, and the holding cost.\n\nLet's denote the number of suppliers as \\( n \\) and the number of units ordered from each supplier as \\( \\frac{3000}{n} \\). The total cost \\( C \\) can be broken down into the following components:\n\n1. **Shipping cost**: Since we use one truck for each supplier, the cost is \\( 1 \\times n = n \\) dollars.\n2. **Cost of the units**: The cost of the units is \\( 3000 \\times 50 = 150000 \\) dollars.\n3. **Ordering cost**: The ordering cost is \\( 450 \\) dollars (since there are 3 suppliers).\n4. ** hold cost**: The holding cost is 23% of the value of the units. The average inventory is half of the units ordered, which is \\( \\frac{3000}{2n} = \\frac{1500}{n} \\). Therefore, the holding cost is \\( 0.23 \\times 50 \\times \\frac{1500}{n} = \\frac{1725}{n} \\) dollars.\n\nThe total cost \\( C \\) is the sum of these components:\n\\[ C = n + 150000 + 450 + \\frac{1725}{n} = n + 150450 + \\frac{1725}{n} \\]\n\nTo find the minimum cost, we need to find the value of \\( n \\) that minimizes \\( C \\). We can do this by taking the derivative of \\( C \\) with respect to \\( n \\) and setting it to zero:\n\\[ \\frac{dC}{dn} = 1 - \\frac{1725}{n^2} = 0 \\]\n\\[ 1 = \\frac{1725}{n^2} \\]\n\\[ n^2 = 1725 \\]\n\\[ n = \\sqrt{1725} \\approx 41.54 \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, we check \\( n = 41 \\) and \\( n = 42 \\) to see which one gives the lower cost.\n\nFor \\( n = 41 \\):\n\\[ C = 41 + 150450 + \\frac{1725}{41} = 41 + 150450 + 42 = 150533 \\]\n\nFor \\( n = 42 \\):\n\\[ C = 42 + 150450 + \\frac{1725}{42} = 42 + 150450 + 41 = 150533 \\]\n\nBoth values are the same, so the optimal order size is \\( n = 41 \\) or \\( n = 42 \\). Since the problem asks for the optimal order size, we can choose either one. For simplicity, we will choose \\( n = 41 \\).\n\nThe optimal order size is \\(\\boxed{41}\\).",
            "To determine the optimal order size when using LQR shipping with a separate truck for each supplier, we need to consider the total cost components: shipping costs, ordering costs, and holding costs.\n\nFirst, let's break down the costs:\n\n1. **Shipping Costs**: Since SuperPart uses LQR shipping with a separate truck for each supplier, the cost per truck is \\$1,150 for three suppliers. If SuperPart orders from three suppliers, the total shipping cost per truck is \\$1,150. However, since the number of suppliers is large, we can generalize the cost per unit for LQR shipping as \\$1,150 per truck.\n\n2. **Ordering Costs**: The ordering cost for each supplier is \\$150 per order, and since there are three suppliers, the total ordering cost per order is \\$450. If SuperPart orders from three suppliers, the total ordering cost per truck is \\$450.\n\n3. ** holdin costs**: The holding cost is 23% of the cost of the product. Since each unit costs \\$50, the holding cost per unit is \\$11.50.\n\nThe optimal order size (Q) can be determined using the economic order quantity formula, which is:\n\\[ Q = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times D \\times C}{H}} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\(D\\) is the annual demand,\n- \\(C\\) is the cost per order,\n- \\(H\\) is the holding cost per unit.\n\nHere, \\(D = 3000\\) units, \\(C = 450\\) dollars, and \\(H = 11.50\\) dollars. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\\[ Q = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 3000 \\times 450}{11.50}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2700000}{11.50}} = \\sqrt{234782.61} \\approx 484.5 \\]\n\nSince the order size must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number, which is 485 units. However, since each truck can carry up to 2000 units, SuperPart can order 485 units in one truck.\n\nThus, the optimal order size if LQR shipping is used with a separate truck for each supplier is \\(\\boxed{485}\\)."
