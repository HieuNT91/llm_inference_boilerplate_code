This is typically done by finding the critical value of the demand distribution that balances the profit from selling boxes at full price and the loss from having unsold boxes sold at a discount.\n\n3. **Calculate the critical value:**\n   The critical value can be found using the newsv normal distribution table or a calculator. The critical value for a normal distribution is the point where the probability of demand being less than or equal to this point is equal to the probability of demand being greater than this point. This is typically the point where the demand is balanced between profit and loss.\n\n   For simplicity, let's assume we are looking for the point where the probability of demand being less than or equal to this point is 50% (the median). This is a common approach in such problems without specific critical value tables.\n\n   The critical value for a normal distribution with a mean of 26,000 and a standard deviation of 9,000 at the 50% point is simply the mean, which is 26,000. However, since we are dealing with a normal distribution, we need to consider the standard deviation to ensure we have enough inventory to meet the demand most of the time.\n\n   A more practical approach is to use the service level, which is the probability that demand will be met. A common service level is 95%, which means we want to have enough inventory to meet 95% of the demand. The z-score for a 95% service level is approximately 1.645.\n\n   Therefore, the optimal number of boxes to manufacture is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Optimal number of boxes} = \\text{Mean} + (z \\times \\text{Standard deviation}) = 26,000 + (1.645 \\times 9,000) = 26,000 + 14,805 = 40,805\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Since the optimal number of boxes to manufacture is 40,805, and since the company sells four different designs, the number of boxes of each design should be:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40,805}{4} = 10,201.25\n   \\]\n   Since we cannot manufacture a fraction of a box, we round to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the company should manufacture approximately 10,201 boxes of each design.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\boxed{10201}",

Here's a step-by-step approach to solving this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the demand distribution and parameters:**\n   - The demand for each box is normally distributed with a mean (\u03bc) of 26,000 and a standard deviation (\u03c3) of 9,000.\n   - The cost to produce each box is \u20ac4.\n   - The selling price of each box is \u20ac6.\n   - The discount price for unsold boxes is \u20ac3.\n   - The holding cost for each box in inventory for the entire year is \u20ac0.50.\n\n2. **Calculate the profit and loss scenarios:**\n   - If a box is sold at \u20ac6, the profit is \u20ac6 - \u20ac4 = \u20ac2.\n   - If a box is sold at \u20ac3, the loss is \u20ac4 - \u20ac3 = \u20ac1.\n   - The holding cost is \u20ac0.50 per box.\n\n3. **Determine the optimal number of boxes to manufacture:**\n   - Let's denote the number of boxes to be manufactured as \\( Q \\).\n   - The expected profit for each box sold is the profit if sold at \u20ac6 minus the expected holding cost if some boxes are held in inventory.\n   - The expected holding cost is the holding cost multiplied by the probability that a box is held in inventory.\n\n4. **Use the newspaper problem approach to find the optimal \\( Q \\):**\n   - The optimal \\( Q \\) is the point where the expected profit is maximized.\n   - The expected profit can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Expected Profit} = 2 \\cdot P(\\text{ boxes sold at \u20ac6}) - 1 \\cdot P(\\text{ boxes sold at \u20ac3}) - 0.5 \\cdot Q \\cdot P(\\text{ boxes held in inventory})\n     \\]\n   - The optimal \\( Q \\) is found by setting the derivative of the expected profit with respect to \\( Q \\) to zero and solving for \\( Q \\).\n\n5. **Solve for the optimal \\( Q \\):**\n   - The optimal \\( Q \\) is the point where the expected profit is maximized, which is typically found using the newspaper problem approach or numerical methods.\n   - For simplicity, we can use the formula for the newspaper problem:\n     \\[\n     Q^* = \\mu + z \\cdot \\sigma\n     \\]\n     where \\( z \\) is the z-score corresponding to the service level that maximizes the expected profit.\n   - The service level is typically chosen to maximize the expected profit, which in this case is around the mean plus one standard deviation (since the demand is normally distributed).\n   - Therefore, \\( Q^* = 26,000 + 1 \\cdot 9,000 = 35,000 \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The optimal number of boxes to manufacture for each design is 35,000.\n   - Since there are four designs, the total number of boxes to be manufactured is \\( 4 \\times 35,000 = 140,000 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of boxes of each design that Frame It should manufacture is \\boxed{35000}.",
            "To determine how many boxes of each design Frame It should manufacture, we need to consider the demand distribution, the cost structure, and the objective of maximizing profit.

The service level is given by the ratio of the profit per box sold to the sum of the profit per box sold and the loss per box unsold.\n   - Service level = \\(\\frac{2}{2 + 1.5} = \\frac{2}{3.5} = \\frac{4}{7}\\).\n\n4. **Find the corresponding z-score for the service level:**\n   - The z-score for a service level of \\(\\frac{4}{7}\\) is approximately 0.5244 (from standard normal distribution tables).\n\n5. **Calculate the optimal inventory level:**\n   - The optimal inventory level is given by the mean demand plus the z-score times the standard deviation.\n   - optimal inventory level = \\(\\mu + z \\cdot \\sigma = 26000 + 0.5244 \\cdot 9000 = 26000 + 4719.6 = 30719.6\\).\n   - Since we cannot have a fraction of a box, we round to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the optimal inventory level is 30720 boxes.\n\n6. **Determine the number of boxes to manufacture for each design:**\n   - Since the demand for each design is normally distributed with the same parameters and the inventory level is the same for all designs, the company should manufacture the same number of boxes for each design.\n   - Therefore, the number of boxes to manufacture for each design is \\(\\frac{30720}{4} = 7680\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{7680}\\)."

The profit for Benetton consists of two parts: the revenue from selling the product to the retailer and the profit from selling the leftover inventory.\n\n1. **Revenue from selling to the retailer:**\n   The retailer buys \\( O \\) units at \\$36 each and sells them at \\$55 each. Therefore, the revenue from selling to the retailer is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue from retailer} = 55O - 36O = 19O\n   \\]\n\n2. **Profit from selling the leftover inventory:**\n   If the retailer sells fewer than \\( O \\) units, Benetton can sell the leftover units at a\ufffd value of \\$25 each.

For a normal random variable \\( D \\) with mean \\( \\mu = 4000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 1600 \\), the expected value of \\( \\max(O - D, 0) \\) is given by:\n\\[\nE[\\max(O - D, 0)] = (O - \\mu) \\Phi\\left(\\frac{O - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) + \\sigma \\phi\\left(\\frac{O - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\Phi \\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution and \\( \\phi \\) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\\[\nE[\\max(O - D, 0)] = (O - 4000) \\Phi\\left(\\frac{O - 4000}{1600}\\right) + 1600 \\phi\\left(\\frac{O - 4000}{1600}\\right)\n\\]\n\nTo find the optimal \\( O \\), we need to maximize the total profit function:\n\\[\nE[\\text{Total profit}] = 19O + 25 \\left[ (O - 4000) \\Phi\\left(\\frac{O - 4000}{1600}\\right) + 1600 \\phi\\left(\\frac{O - 4000}{1600}\\right) \\right]\n\\]\n\nThis is a complex optimization problem that typically requires numerical methods or simulation to solve.

            "To determine the expected profit for Benetton under the retailer's optimal order size \\(O\\), we need to consider the expected demand and the costs and revenues associated with different levels of demand. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Define Variables and Costs:**\n   - Production cost per unit for Benetton: \\$20\n   -Wholesale price per unit: \\$36\n   -wholesale price per unit to the retailer: \\$55\n   -Smaller wholesale price per unit to the retailer: \\$25\n   - Smaller wholesale price per unit for Benetton's leftover inventory: \\$10\n   - Mean demand: 4000 units\n   - Standard deviation of demand: 1600 units\n\n2. **Determine the Optimal Order Size \\(O\\):**\n   The optimal order size \\(O\\) is the point where the expected profit is maximized. This can be found by balancing the expected revenue and cost. However, for simplicity, we can use the newspaper problem approach and assume the optimal order size is around the mean demand plus a certain multiple of the standard deviation. Given the problem's context, we can use the critical value approach for the normal distribution.\n\n   The critical value for the newspaper problem is typically the point where the expected profit is maximized. For a normal distribution, this is often close to the mean plus a certain multiple of the standard deviation. Given the problem's context, we can assume the optimal order size \\(O\\) is around 4000 units (mean) plus a certain multiple of the standard deviation. For simplicity, we can assume \\(O = 4000\\) units.\n\n3. **Calculate the Expected Profit:**\n   - If the retailer orders 4000 units, the expected profit can be calculated as follows:\n     - Revenue from selling 4000 units to the retailer: \\(4000 \\times 55 = 220000\\)\n     - Cost of producing 4000 units: \\(4000 \\times 20 = 80000\\)\n     - Revenue from selling any unsold units at a loss: If demand is less than 4000, the retailer can only sell up to 4000 units. So, if the demand is \\(D\\), the revenue from selling the unsold units is \\((4000 - D) \\times (55 - 36) = (4000 - D) \\times 19\\).\n     - Cost of purchasing the unsold units at a discount: If demand is less than 4000, the retailer can only buy up to 4000 units. So, if the demand is \\(D\\), the cost of buying the unsold units is \\((4000 - D) \\times (36 - 20) = (4000 - D) \\times 16\\).\n     - Revenue from selling any unsold units at a discount: If demand is less than 4000, the retailer can only sell up to 4000 units. So, if the demand is \\(D\\), the revenue from selling the unsold units at a discount is \\((4000 - D) \\times 25\\).\n     - Cost of purchasing the unsold units at a discount: If demand is less than 4000, the retailer can only buy up to 4000 units. So, if the demand is \\(D\\), the cost of buying the unsold units at a discount is \\((4000 - D) \\times 10\\).\n     - The expected profit is the expected revenue minus the expected cost.\n\n   The expected profit can be simplified to:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Profit} = 220000 - 80000 + \\text{Expected Revenue from unsold units} - \\text{Expected Cost of buying unsold units}\n   \\]\n   Since the problem is complex, we can use the simplified approach of the newspaper problem and assume the expected profit is close to the profit if the retailer orders exactly the mean demand.\n\n   The expected profit if the retailer orders 4000 units is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Profit} = 220000 - 80000 = 140000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected profit for Benetton under the retailer's optimal order size \\(O\\) is \\(\\boxed{140000}\\).",
            "To determine the expected profit for Benetton under the retailer's optimal order size \\( O \\), we need to calculate the expected profit for different values of \\( O \\) and find the one that maximizes the profit. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the profit function\nThe profit function \\( \\Pi \\) depends on the number of units ordered \\( O \\). The profit consists of revenue, cost, and the value of any unsold units.\n\n- **Revenue**: The retailer buys \\( O \\) units at \\$36 each and sells them at \\$55 each.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Revenue} = 55O\n  \\]\n\n- **Cost**: Benetton produces \\( O \\) units at \\$20 each.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Cost} = 20O\n  \\]\n\n- **Selling Price**: If there are any unsold units, they are sold at a\u53f0er value of \\$25 each.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Selling Price} = 25(O - D)^+ \\quad \\text{where} \\quad D \\text{ is the demand}\n  \\]\n\n- **Chlorine Cost**: Benetton can sell any unsold units at a precision value of \\$10 each.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Chlorine Cost} = 10(O - D)^- \\quad \\text{where} \\quad (O - D)^- = \\max(0, O - D)\n  \\]\n\nCombining these, the profit function is:\n\\[\n\\Pi = 55O - 20O + 25(O - D)^+ + 10(O - D)^- - 20O\n\\]\nSimplify the profit function:\n\\[\n\\Pi = 15O + 25(O - D)^+ + 10(O - D)^- - 20O\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Pi = 15O + 15O - 20O + 25(O - D)^+ + 10(O - D)^- - 20O\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Pi = 35O - 20O + 25(O - D)^+ + 10(O - D)^- - 20O\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Pi = 15O + 25(O - D)^+ + 10(O - D)^- - 20O\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the expected profit\nThe expected profit is the expected value of the profit function.

            "To determine the expected profit for Benetton under the retailer's optimal order size \\(O\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the profit function**: The profit for Benetton depends on the number of units ordered \\(O\\) and the demand \\(D\\). The profit function is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = 36O - 20O + 25E[(O - D)^+]\n   \\]\n   where \\(E[(O - D)^+]\\) is the expected value of the leftover inventory sold at thesalvage value.

This can be found by balancing the cost of ordering too many units with the revenue lost from selling units at a discount. The optimal order size can be approximated using the newspaper effect, which states that the optimal order size is close to the forecasted demand plus the critical value of the demand distribution.\n\n   The critical value for a normally distributed demand with mean \\(\\mu = 4000\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 1600\\) can be found using the standard normal distribution table. The critical value for a service level of 95% (which is the default in many cases) is approximately 1.645. Therefore, the optimal order size is:\n   \\[\n   O = \\mu + 1.645\\sigma = 4000 + 1.645 \\times 1600 = 4000 + 2632 = 6632\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the expected profit**: The expected profit is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = 16O + 25E[(O - D)^+]\n   \\]\n   where \\(E[(O - D)^+]\\) is the expected value of the leftover inventory sold at thesalvage value. Since the demand \\(D\\) is normally distributed with mean 4000 and standard deviation 1600, the expected value of the leftover inventory sold at thesalvage value is:\n   \\[\n   E[(O - D)^+ = O - \\mu + \\sigma \\times \\Phi(-\\frac{O - \\mu}{\\sigma})\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\Phi\\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.

            "To determine the expected profit for Benetton under the retailer's optimal order size \\( O \\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the profit function**: The profit \\( \\Pi \\) depends on the number of units ordered \\( O \\) and the demand \\( D \\). The profit function can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\Pi = (36 - 20) \\min(O, D) + (25 - 20) \\max(O - D, 0) - 10 \\max(O - D, 0)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\Pi = 16 \\min(O, D) + 15 \\max(O - D, 0)\n   \\]\n   This can be further broken down into two cases:\n   - If \\( D \\leq O \\), then \\( \\min(O, D) = D \\) and \\( \\max(O - D, 0) = 0 \\), so the profit is:\n     \\[\n     \\Pi = 16D\n     \\]\n   - If \\( D > O \\), then \\( \\min(O, D) = O \\) and \\( \\max(O - D, 0) = D - O \\), so the profit is:\n     \\[\n     \\Pi = 16O + 15(D - O) = 16O + 15D - 15O = O + 15D\n     \\]\n   Therefore, the profit function can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\Pi = \\begin{cases} \n   16D & \\text{if } D \\leq O \\\\\n   O + 15D & \\text{if } D > O \n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the optimal order size \\( O \\)**: To find the optimal order size \\( O \\), we need to maximize the expected profit. The expected profit \\( E[\\Pi] \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   E[\\Pi] = 16 E[\\min(O, D)] + 15 E[\\max(O - D, 0)]\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of the normal distribution, we can calculate the expected values.

This typically requires numerical methods or simulation. For simplicity, we can use a rule of thumb that the optimal order size is approximately the mean plus the critical value of the standard normal distribution times the standard deviation. The critical value for a 90% service level (to cover 90% of the demand) is about 1.28. Therefore, the optimal order size is:\n   \\[\n   O = 4000 + 1.28 \\times 1600 = 5024\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the expected profit for \\( O = 5024 \\)**: Using the optimal order size \\( O = 5024 \\), we can calculate the expected profit. The expected profit is:\n   \\[\n   E[\\Pi] = 16 E[\\min(5024, D)] + 15 E[\\max(5024 - D, 0)]\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of the normal distribution, we get:\n   \\[\n   E[\\min(5024, D)] = 5024 - 1600 \\phi\\left(\\frac{5024 - 4000}{1600}\\right) + 4000 \\Phi\\left(\\frac{5024 - 4000}{1600}\\right) = 5024 - 1600 \\times 0.0401 + 4000 \\times 0.8408 = 5024 - 64.16 + 3363.2 = 7323.04\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E[\\max(5024 - D, 0)] = (5024 - 4000) \\Phi\\left(\\frac{5024 - 4000}{1600}\\right) + 1600 \\phi\\left(\\frac{5024 - 4000}{1600}\\right) = 1024 \\times 0.8408 + 1600 \\times 0.0401 = 858.432 + 64.16 = 922.592\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the expected profit is:\n   \\[\n   E[\\Pi] = 16 \\times 7323.04 + 15 \\times 922.592 = 117168.64 + 13838.88 = 131007.52\n   \\]\n\nThe expected profit for Benetton under the retailer's optimal order size \\( O \\) is \\(\\boxed{131007.52}\\)."

            "To determine how many additional rooms the Stoneion should hold for corporate clients after the prices double, we need to analyze the demand for both groups of customers before and after the price increase.\n\n### Step 1: Initial demand analysis\n- **Corporate clients**: The initial price is \\$250 per person. The demand is normal with a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 10. If the price doubles to \\$500, the demand will likely decrease significantly because the demand is normally distributed and the price is a significant portion of the demand.\n- **Young couples**: The initial price is \\$150 per person. The demand is also normal with a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 10. If the price doubles to \\$300, the demand will also likely decrease significantly.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the new demand after the price increase\nThe price increase for both groups will significantly reduce the demand. However, the exact reduction depends on the coefficient of price\u654f\u611fness of the customers, which is not provided. For simplicity, let's assume that the demand is halved for both groups after the price increase.\n\n- **Corporate clients**: Initial demand = 20.

After price increase, demand = 20/2 = 10.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the additional rooms needed\nInitially, the stoneion serves the full demand of both groups. After the price increase, the stoneion will serve only half the demand of each group.

The demand pattern for corporate clients is normal with a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 10. This means that the average number of corporate rooms needed is 20, but the actual number can vary by up to 10 rooms in either direction.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Initial demand for young couples\nThe initial price for young couples is $150 per person. Since the problem does not specify the demand pattern for young couples, we will assume that the demand for young couples remains the same before and after the price increase.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the New Prices\nAfter the price increase, the corporate rate will be $500 per person, and the price for young couples will be $300 per person.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the New demand for corporate clients\nWith the new price, the profit per corporate room will double. If the original profit per corporate room was $250 - $250 = $0 (since the revenue and cost are the same), the new profit per corporate room will be $500 - $500 = $0. However, the number of corporate rooms needed will remain the same on average because the demand pattern is the same and the profit per room is the same as before the price increase. Therefore, the number of corporate rooms needed does not change.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the New demand for young couples\nWith the new price, the profit per young couple room will double. If the original profit per young couple room was $150 - $150 = $0 (since the revenue and cost are the same), the new profit per young couple room will be $300 - $300 = $0. However, the number of young couples needed will remain the same on average because the demand pattern is the same and the profit per room is the same as before the price increase. Therefore, the number of young couples needed does not change.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince the number of corporate rooms needed does not change and the number of young couples needed does not change, the Stoneionn should not hold any additional rooms for corporate clients.

This means that the same number of corporate rooms sold will generate twice the revenue compared to before the price increase. Therefore, the demand for corporate rooms will not change, as the price increase does not affect the demand directly but rather the revenue generated from the demand.\n\nSince the demand for corporate rooms remains the same (mean of 20), the stoneion should not hold additional rooms for corporate clients after the price increase.

If we sell fewer rooms to corporate clients, we can sell more rooms to young couples, but we need to ensure that the expected profit from the young couples is at least as much as the profit from selling the remaining rooms at the reduced price.\n\nThe expected profit from selling the remaining rooms to young couples at the reduced price is:\n\\[ 150 \\times (N - n) \\]\n\nThe cost of not selling the rooms to young couples is the profit lost from selling the rooms at the reduced price:\n\\[ 225 \\times (N - n) \\]\n\nThe total profit is then:\n\\[ P = 250n + 150 \\times 20 - 225 \\times (N - n) = 250n + 3000 - 225N + 225n = 475n - 225N + 3000 \\]\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the value of \\( n \\) that maximizes this expression.

This means that the number of corporate rooms needed can be modeled as \\(N(20, 10^2)\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the new price for young couples:**\n   The original price for young couples is $150.

However, the problem does not specify the exact relationship between price and the number of young couples, so we will assume that the number of young couples will still be around the mean of 20 (since the price increase is not extreme).\n\n4. **Estimate the number of young couples and corporate rooms needed:**\n   If the number of young couples is expected to be around 20, and assuming the revenue from young couples is still significant, theores truncated should be enough to accommodate the young couples. However, since the problem asks for the number of corporate rooms to be reserved, we need to consider the probability that more than 20 young couples will stay.\n\n   Given that the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 10, the probability that the demand is greater than 20 is 50% (since the mean is 20). This means that on average, half of the time more than 20 young couples will stay, and half of the time fewer than 20 will stay. However, since the problem asks for the number of corporate rooms to be reserved, we should consider the worst-case scenario where the number of young couples is high.\n\n   Therefore, to be safe and to ensure that we have enough rooms for the maximum number of young couples that might stay, we should plan for a slightly higher number of corporate rooms than the mean demand.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solving the problem:\n\n1. **Define Variables and Given Data:**\n   - Total warehouse capacity: 100,000 square feet\n   - Upfront monthly fee per customer: \\$200\n   - Monthly fee per square foot used: \\$3\n   - Cost of extra space per square foot: \\$6\n   - forecasted unused space is normally distributed with a mean of 15% of the contracted amount and a coefficient of variation of 0.6.\n\n2. **Calculate the Mean of the unused space:**\n   Let \\( x \\) be the total space signed up for in square feet. The mean of the unused space is \\( 0.15x \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Standard Deviation of the unused space:**\n   The coefficient of variation is 0.6, which means the standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\) is \\( 0.6 \\times 0.15x = 0.09x \\).\n\n4. **Expected Cost of unused space:**\n   The expected cost of the unused space is \\( 0.09x \\times 6 = 0.54x \\) dollars per month.\n\n5. **Expected Cost of the space signed up for:**\n   The cost of the space signed up for is \\( 3 \\times (x - 0.15x) = 3 \\times 0.85x = 2.55x \\) dollars per month.\n\n6. **Expected Total Cost:**\n   The expected total cost is the sum of the upfront fee and the expected cost of the space signed up for plus the expected cost of the unused space:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Total Cost} = 200 + 2.55x + 0.54x = 200 + 3.09x\n   \\]\n\n7. **Minimize the Expected Total Cost:**\n   To minimize the expected total cost, we need to find the value of \\( x \\) that minimizes the expression \\( 200 + 3.09x \\). Since the cost increases linearly with \\( x \\), the minimum cost occurs at the maximum possible \\( x \\) that the warehouse can sign up for, which is 100,000 square feet.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   The manager should sign contracts for the maximum capacity of the warehouse, which is 100,000 square feet.\n\nTherefore, the total space that the manager should sign contracts for is \\(\\boxed{100000}\\).",
            "To determine the optimal space to sign contracts for, we need to balance the expected revenue against the risk of not selling all the space. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the total space (in square feet) signed up for the contracts.\n   - The warehouse's capacity is 100,000 square feet.\n   - The upfront monthly fee per customer is \\$200.\n   - The fee per square foot used is \\$3.\n   - The cost per square foot for unused space is \\$6.\n   - The mean unused space is 15% of the contracted amount.\n   - The coefficient of variation of the unused space is 0.6.\n\n2. **Expected unused space:**\n   - The mean of the unused space is \\( 0.15x \\).\n   - The coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean. Therefore, the standard deviation of the unused space is \\( 0.6 \\times 0.15x = 0.09x \\).\n\n3. **Expected space used:**\n   - The expected space used is \\( x - 0.15x = 0.85x \\).\n\n4. **Expected revenue:**\n   - The revenue from the upfront fees is \\( 200 \\times \\text{number of customers} \\). Since the number of customers is not specified, we assume the revenue is directly proportional to the space signed up for.\n   - The revenue from the space used is \\( 3 \\times 0.85x = 2.55x \\).\n   - The cost for unused space is \\( 6 \\times 0.15x = 0.9x \\).\n   - The expected revenue is \\( 2.55x - 0.9x = 1.65x \\).\n\n5. **Expected profit:**\n   - The expected profit is the expected revenue minus the upfront fees. Since the upfront fees are not specified, we focus on the expected revenue from the space used.\n   - The expected profit is \\( 1.65x \\).\n\n6. **Maximize Expected Profit:**\n   - To maximize the expected profit, we need to find the value of \\( x \\) that maximizes \\( 1.65x \\). Since the coefficient of variation of the unused space is relatively high, the manager should consider the risk of not selling all the space.\n   - A reasonable approach is to consider the case where the manager signs up for just enough space to cover the expected usage. Given the mean unused space is 15%, the manager should consider signing up for 100,000 square feet, as it is the warehouse's capacity.\n\nTherefore, the total space that the manager should sign contracts for is \\(\\boxed{100000}\\) square feet.",
            "To determine the total space that the manager should sign contracts for, we need to consider the expected usage of space and the costs associated with it. The manager believes that customers are unlikely to use the full contracted amount at all times, and he forecasts that unused space will be normally distributed with a mean of 15 percent of the contracted amount and a coefficient of variation of 0.6. This means that the standard deviation of the unused space is 15% of the contracted amount multiplied by the coefficient of variation.\n\nLet's denote the total space that the manager should sign contracts for as \\( S \\) square feet. The mean of the unused space is \\( 0.15S \\) square feet, and the standard deviation of the unused space is \\( 0.6 \\times 0.15S = 0.09S \\) square feet.\n\nThe expected usage of space is \\( S - 0.15S = 0.85S \\) square feet. The cost for the space used is the upfront monthly fee plus the fee for the space used. The upfront monthly fee is \\$200 per customer, and the fee for the space used is \\$3 per square foot. Therefore, the cost for the space used is \\( 200 + 3 \\times 0.85S \\).\n\nThe cost for the unused space is the cost of arranging for extra space at a price of \\$6 per square foot. The expected amount of unused space is \\( 0.15S \\) square feet, so the cost for the unused space is \\( 6 \\times 0.15S = 0.9S \\).\n\nThe total expected cost is the sum of the cost for the space used and the cost for the unused space:\n\\[\n200 + 3 \\times 0.85S + 0.9S = 200 + 2.55S + 0.9S = 200 + 3.45S\n\\]\n\nTo minimize the total expected cost, we need to find the value of \\( S \\) that minimizes this expression. However, since the problem does not provide any constraints on the total cost or the expected usage, we can assume that the manager wants to balance the cost of the space with the cost of the unused space. A common approach is to set the expected cost of the space used equal to the cost of the unused space, which gives us:\n\\[\n3.45S = 0.9S\n\\]\n\nThis equation is not valid because it implies \\( S = 0 \\), which is not a practical solution. Instead, we can use the fact that the manager believes that customers are unlikely to use the full contracted amount at all times, and he forecasts that unused space will be normally distributed with a mean of 15 percent of the contracted amount and a coefficient of variation of 0.6. This means that the manager should sign contracts for a space that is more than 100,000 square feet, but not so much that the expected usage is significantly less than the contracted amount.\n\nGiven the problem's context, the manager should sign contracts for a space that is more than 100,000 square feet but not significantly more, since the forecasted mean of the unused space is only 15% of the contracted amount. Therefore, the manager should sign contracts for a space that is just above 100,000 square feet. A reasonable choice would be to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 100,001 square feet.\n\nThus, the total space that the manager should sign contracts for is \\(\\boxed{100000}\\) square feet.",

The expected unused space is 15% of \\( x \\), which is \\( 0.15x \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost:**\n   The total cost consists of the upfront fees, the cost of the contracted space, and the cost of the unused space.\n   - Upfront fees: \\( 100,000 \\times 200 = 20,000,000 \\) dollars.\n   - Cost of the contracted space: \\( 3x \\) dollars.\n   - Cost of the unused space: \\( 6 \\times 0.15x = 0.9x \\) dollars.\n   - Total cost: \\( 20,000,000 + 3x + 0.9x = 20,000,000 + 3.9x \\).\n\n4. **Maximize the Total Cost:**\n   To maximize the total cost, we need to find the value of \\( x \\) that maximizes the expression \\( 20,000,000 + 3.9x \\). Since the coefficient of variation (0.6) indicates a relatively high variability in the unused space, the manager should consider the worst-case scenario where the unused space is at its maximum expected value.\n\n5. **Consider the Maximum Expected Used Space:**\n   The maximum expected used space is \\( x - 0.15x = 0.85x \\). Since the warehouse has a total capacity of 100,000 square feet, the maximum expected used space cannot exceed 100,000 square feet.

He forecasts that unused space will be normally distributed with a mean of 15 percent of the contracted amount and a coefficient of variation of 0.6. We need to find the optimal level of space to sign contracts for that minimizes the expected cost while considering the cost of unused space.\n\nLet's denote the total space signed up for by \\( x \\) square feet.

However, since the problem does not provide a specific time frame or other constraints, we can assume the manager wants to maximize the expected usage while keeping the cost manageable. Given the coefficient of variation of 0.6, which indicates a relatively high variability in the unused space, the manager should consider a reasonable level of space that maximizes the expected usage while keeping the expected cost manageable.\n\nA reasonable approach is to consider the mean of the normal distribution of unused space, which is 15 percent of the contracted amount.

Given the information, we can make a reasonable assumption that the manager wants to balance the cost of overulating space against the potential savings from not having to arrange for additional space.\n\nSince the problem does not provide a specific target cost, we can infer that the optimal \\( S \\) is likely to be close to the warehouse's capacity of 100,000 square feet, but slightly less to account for the possibility of unused space. Given the coefficient of variation and the forecasted distribution, a reasonable approach is to consider the 95% confidence interval for the unused space. For a normal distribution, 95% of the data falls within approximately 1.96 standard deviations of the mean.

The students enjoyed this happy little island and the professor liked it because he could supplement his income by bringing back a few boxes souvenirs he could sell to his friends. The souvenirs cost the professor \\$125 a box and he sells them for \\$290 a box. Souvenirs that dry out due to age can be sold for \\$80. Experience has shown that the demand for boxes of these souvenirs has a mean of 80 with a standard deviation of 20. Naturally, the professor will purchase the optimal number of boxes.

            "To determine the expected profit for the professor, we need to consider the cost of purchasing the boxes, the revenue from selling them, and the probability of different demand scenarios.
