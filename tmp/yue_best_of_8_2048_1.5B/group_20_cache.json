Orion currently sells ten\nvariants of a copier, with all inventory kept in finished-goods form. The primary component that differentiates the copiers is the printing subassembly. An idea being discussed is to introduce commonality in the printing subassembly so that final assembly can be postponed and inventories kept in component form. Currently, each copier costs \\$1,000 in terms of components. Introducing commonality in the print subassembly will increase component costs to \\$1,025. One of the ten variants represents 80 percent of the total demand. Weekly demand for this variant is normally distributed, with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 200. Each of the remaining nine variants has a weekly demand of 28 with a standard deviation of 20. Orion aims to provide a 95 percent level of service. Replenishment lead time for components is four weeks. Copier assembly can be completed in a matter of hours. Orion manages all inventories using a continuous review policy and incurs an annual holding cost of 20 percent. What is the annual holding cost without component commonality?\nassistant\n",

The increase in delivery charge comes from the additional cost of operating the shuttle from the central location to each of the other locations. At each retail outlet, DoorRed follows a periodic review policy with weekly replenishment (a replenishment order is placed once every seven days). The replenishment lead time is three days. DoorRed plans to stick to once- a-week ordering even if a drug is centralized. DoorRed incurs an annual inventory holding cost of 20 percent and aims for a cycle service level of 99 percent.

Since there are 25 retail outlets, the total daily demand \\(D\\) is the sum of 25 independent normal random variables, each with mean 5 and standard deviation 4.

The holding cost for the centralizing drug is:\n\\[ \\text{ hold\\_cost\\_centralized} = 4300 \\times 10 \\times 0.20 = 8600 \\]\nThe holding cost for the non centralizing drugs is:\n\\[ \\text{hold\\_cost\\_non\\_centralized} = 25 \\times (125 \\times 10 \\times 0.20) = 6250 \\]\nSo the total holding cost is:\n\\[ \\text{total\\_ holding\\_cost} = 8600 + 6250 = 14850 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total delivery cost for the centralized drug\nThe delivery cost is $0.02 per unit per day, and the lead time is 3 days.

The sponsor is independently wealthy, so he donates his time and materials to the fundraising effort. Club officers set up a card table in the atrium of the business building and take turns staffing it for the duration of the barbecue season, which is four months. Eighteen sad years of experience have revealed that demand varies depending on the month of the season. Customer demand in the first month can be described as $400-p_1$, in the second month as $400-1.4\\times p_2$, in the third month $400-1.8\\times p_3$, and in the fourth month $400-2.2\\times p_4$. Responding to customer complaints (primarily from period 1 purchasers) the student APICS chapter decides to use static pricing over the four month season. The club sponsor makes a deal with the local bootlegger to supply him with all the mason jars he will need for the barbecue season. What is the total revenue for the season's sales at the optimal price?\nassistant\n",

Orion currently sells ten\nvariants of a copier, with all inventory kept in finished-goods form. The primary component that differentiates the copiers is the printing subassembly. An idea being discussed is to introduce commonality in the printing subassembly so that final assembly can be postponed and inventories kept in component form. Currently, each copier costs \\$1,000 in terms of components. Introducing commonality in the print subassembly will increase component costs to \\$1,025. One of the ten variants represents 80 percent of the total demand. Weekly demand for this variant is normally distributed, with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 200. Each of the remaining nine variants has a weekly demand of 28 with a standard deviation of 20. Orion aims to provide a 95 percent level of service. Replenishment lead time for components is four weeks. Copier assembly can be completed in a matter of hours. Orion manages all inventories using a continuous review policy and incurs an annual holding cost of 20 percent. At what cost of commonality will complete commonality be justified?\nassistant\n",

The current system involves having 10 different variants with different component costs, while the proposed system involves commonality in the printing subunit to reduce component costs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total component cost for the current system. The cost of components for each variant is \\$1,000, and there are 10 variants. Therefore, the total component cost is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 1000 = 10000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total component cost for the proposed system. The cost of components for the variant that represents 80% of the total demand is \\$1,025, and the cost for the remaining nine variants is \\$1,000 each.

The lead time is 4 weeks, and the service level is 95%, which corresponds to a z-score of 1.645.\n\nFor the current system, the component cost is \\$1,000, so the holding cost per week is:\n\\[ 0.2 \\times 1000 = 200 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nThe total holding cost for the current system over 4 weeks is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 200 = 800 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFor the proposed system, the component cost is \\$1,025, so the holding cost per week is:\n\\[ 0.2 \\times 1025 = 205 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nThe total holding cost for the proposed system over 4 weeks is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 205 = 820 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost for both systems.

Let \\( x \\) be the component cost increase. The component cost for the variant that represents 80% of the total demand in the proposed system is \\( 1000 + x \\), and the component cost for the remaining nine variants is still \\$1,000 each.

All four styles have demand that is normally distributed. The best-selling style has an expected demand of 30,000 and a standard deviation of 5,000. Each of the other three styles has an expected demand of 10,000 with a standard deviation of 4,000 . Currently, all sweaters are produced before the start of the season. Production cost is $\\$ 20$ per sweater, and they are sold for a wholesale price of $\\$ 35$. Any unsold sweaters at the end of the season are discounted to $\\$ 15$, and they all sell at that price. It costs $\\$ 2$ to hold the sweater in inventory for the entire season if it does not sell. TKC is considering the postponement of knitting and using flexible machines. This will require the base sweaters to be made in advance (identical for each of the four types) and the final patterns to be knit later. This will increase production cost per sweater to $21.40.

            "To determine the optimal total expected profit under the given policy, we need to consider both the production and inventory costs for each sweater style and then calculate the expected profit for each style.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the optimal production quantity for each sweater style under the base production policy.\n\n#### Base style:\n- Expected demand: 30,000\n- Standard deviation: 5,000\n- Production cost: $20\n- Selling price: $35\n- Discounted price: $15\n- holdover cost: $2\n\nThe optimal production quantity for the base style can be determined using the newsva (single-s successive approximation) method or by solving the newsva equations.

The remaining sweaters will be produced before the season:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total expected demand} = x + (30,000 - x) = 60,000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue} = 35 \\times 60,000 - 2 \\times x = 2,100,000 - 2x\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cost of producing sweaters:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost} = 21.40 \\times 60,000 = 1,284,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of holding inventory:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{ inventory cost} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of sweaters produced during the season} = 2x\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total profit:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost} - \\text{ inventory cost} = (2,100,000 - 2x) - 1,284,000 - 2x = 816,000 - 4x\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Optimal Number of sweaters to produce during the season\nTo maximize profit, we need to find the value of \\( x \\) that maximizes the profit function:\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = 816,000 - 4x\n\\]\nSince the profit function is linear and decreasing, the maximum profit occurs when \\( x \\) is minimized. The minimum value of \\( x \\) is 0, which means producing all sweaters before the season.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Profits\n- **Regular production profit:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Profit} = 900,000\n  \\]\n- **Post wrap production profit (with \\( x = 0 \\)):**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Profit} = 816,000\n  \\]\n\nSince the profit from regular production is higher, Knitting Company should not use flexible machines and should manufacture all sweaters in advance.\n\nThus, the number of sweaters to manufacture with flexible machines is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{60000}\n\\]",

Although the demand for each region is independent, the supply lead time is more or less the same\u2014four weeks. Each machine costs \\$1,000 and the holding cost is 20 percent. With the next-day delivery promise, the branch office needs to bear an inland trucking cost of \\$10/unit for all four regional centers. However, if a single national distribution center is decided upon, a more expensive transport fleet is needed and that will cost \\$13/unit for next-day service. Setting up and operating four regional DCs costs \\$150,000 per year more than building and operating the single Ningbo national distribution center.

Daily demand at the Memphis warehouse is normally distributed, with a mean of 5,000 and a standard deviation of 4,000. The warehouse aims for a CSL of 99 percent. The company is debating whether to use sea or air transportation from China. Sea transportation results in a lead time of 36 days and costs $0.50 per phone. Air transportation results in a lead time of 4 days and costs $1.50 per phone. Each phone costs $100, and Motorola incurs an annual holding cost of 20 percent. Given the minimum lot sizes, Motorola would order 100,000 phones at a time (on average, once every 20 days) if using sea transport and 5,000 phones at a time (on average, daily) if using air transport. To begin with, assume that Motorola takes ownership of the inventory on delivery.

            "To determine the total cost under sea transportation, we need to calculate both the holding cost and the ordering cost, and then sum them up.

The daily demand is normally distributed with a mean of 5,000 and a standard deviation of 4,000. The lead time demand is also normally distributed with a mean of \\(5000 \\times 36 = 180000\\) and a standard deviation of \\(4000 \\times \\sqrt{36} = 24000\\).\n\n2. **Determine the safety stock:**\n   Since the company aims for a one-day service level, we need to find the z-score corresponding to the 99th percentile of the standard normal distribution. The z-score for a 99th percentile is approximately 2.33. The safety stock is then \\(2.33 \\times 24000 = 55920\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the total inventory level:**\n   The total inventory level is the sum of the lead time demand and the safety stock, which is \\(180000 + 55920 = 235920\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the holding cost:**\n   The holding cost is 20% of the value of the inventory. The value of the inventory is \\(235920 \\times 100 \\times 0.20 = 47184000\\).

Daily demand at the Memphis warehouse is normally distributed, with a mean of 5,000 and a standard deviation of 4,000. The warehouse aims for a CSL of 99 percent. The company is debating whether to use sea or air transportation from China. Sea transportation results in a lead time of 36 days and costs $0.50 per phone. Air transportation results in a lead time of 4 days and costs $1.50 per phone. Each phone costs $100, and Motorola incurs an annual holding cost of 20 percent. Given the minimum lot sizes, Motorola would order 100,000 phones at a time (on average, once every 20 days) if using sea transport and 5,000 phones at a time (on average, daily) if using air transport.

The lead time is 4 days, and the daily demand is normally distributed with a mean of 5,000 and a standard deviation of 4,000. The lead time demand is also normally distributed with a mean of \\(5000 \\times 4 = 20000\\) and a standard deviation of \\(4000 \\times \\sqrt{4} = 8000\\).\n\nThe safety stock is calculated to meet a 99% service level, which corresponds to a z-score of 2.33 (from the standard normal distribution table).

Therefore, the average inventory level is:\n\\[ \\frac{38640}{2} = 19320 \\]\n\nThe annual holding cost is 20% of the cost of the phones.

Each of the remaining nine variants has a weekly demand of 28 with a standard deviation of 20. Orion aims to provide a 95 percent level of service.

We'll use the concept of expected value and the given probabilities to find the optimal number of fish tacos to make.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of fish tacos prepared.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of chicken tacos prepared.\n\nThe total number of tacos prepared each day is limited to 3000, so we have the constraint:\n\\[ x + y = 3000 \\]\n\nThe revenue from selling the tacos is given by:\n\\[ 15x + 10y - 5x - 4y = 10x + 6y \\]\n\nThe cost of making the tacos is:\n\\[ 5x + 4y \\]\n\nThe profit is the revenue minus the cost:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = (10x + 6y) - (5x + 4y) = 5x + 2y \\]\n\nSince \\( y = 3000 - x \\), we can substitute this into the profit equation:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 5x + 2(3000 - x) = 5x + 6000 - 2x = 3x + 6000 \\]\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to maximize \\( 3x + 6000 \\). Since the profit is a linear function and increases with \\( x \\), the maximum profit will occur when \\( x \\) is as large as possible, given the constraints.\n\nThe demand for chicken tacos is 2500 with a standard deviation of 600, and the demand for fish tacos is 2000 with a standard deviation of 500. The probability distribution of demand is not given, but we can assume that the manager will try to meet the highest demand possible within the constraint.\n\nGiven the constraint \\( x + y = 3000 \\), the maximum number of fish tacos that can be prepared is 3000. However, we need to check if this is feasible given the demand constraints.\n\nIf the manager makes 3000 fish tacos, he will have 3000 fish tacos available, which is more than the maximum demand for fish tacos (2000). Therefore, the manager will meet the maximum demand for fish tacos, which is 2000.\n\nThe remaining 1000 tacos will be chicken tacos. The demand for chicken tacos is 2500 with a standard deviation of 600, so the manager will meet the maximum demand for chicken tacos, which is 2500. Since he only needs to make 1000 chicken tacos, he will meet the maximum demand for chicken tacos, which is 1000.\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of fish tacos to prepare is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2000} \\]",
