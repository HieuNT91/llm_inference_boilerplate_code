            "To determine the recommended reorder point for Door Red, we need to consider both the service level and the cost of understocking. The reorder point is the level of inventory at which a new order should be placed to avoid running out of stock before the next delivery.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables and parameters:\n- Mean daily demand (\\(\\mu\\)) = 40 bottles\n- Standard deviation of daily demand (\\(\\sigma\\)) = 5 bottles\n- lead time = 1 day\n- Current inventory = 45 bottles\n- Cost per bottle = \\$4\n- Annual holding cost rate = 25%\n- Cost of understocking = \\$1.50 per bottle\n\nTheReorder Point (R) can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ R = \\mu \\times \\text{ lead time} + z \\times \\sigma \\]\nwhere \\(z\\) is the z-score corresponding to the desired service level. However, since the service level is not specified, we will assume a service level that balances the cost of holding inventory and the cost of back orders. A common approach is to use a service level that corresponds to a z-score of 1.65, which provides a service level of approximately 95%.\n\nUsing \\(z = 1.65\\):\n\\[ R = 40 \\times 1 + 1.65 \\times 5 = 40 + 8.25 = 48.25 \\]\nSince the inventory is measured in whole bottles, we round up to the next whole number:\n\\[ R = 49 \\]\n\nTo confirm that this reorder point minimizes the total cost, we can check the expected cost of holding inventory and the expected cost of back orders. The expected cost of holding inventory is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Expected holding cost} = \\frac{Q}{2} \\times H \\]\nwhere \\(Q\\) is the order quantity and \\(H\\) is the holding cost per bottle per year. The expected cost of back orders is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Expected back order cost} = \\left( \\text{mean demand} - R \\right) \\times C \\times h \\]\nwhere \\(C\\) is the cost of back orders per bottle, \\(h\\) is the holding cost per bottle per year, and \\(Q\\) is the order quantity.\n\nHowever, since the problem does not provide the order quantity, we can use the reorder point formula directly and assume that the service level is met at a reasonable cost. Therefore, the recommendedReorder Point is:\n\\[ \\boxed{49} \\]",
            "To determine the recommendedRe order point for DoorRed, we need to consider both the lead time and the cost of understocking. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the lead time and demand parameters:**\n   - lead time = 1 day\n   - Mean daily demand = 40 bottles\n   - Standard deviation of daily demand = 5 bottles\n\n2. **Calculate the expected demand during the lead time:**\n   Since the lead time is 1 day, the expected demand during the lead time is the same as the mean daily demand:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected demand during lead time} = 40 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the safety stock:**\n   safety stock is the amount of inventory needed to cover the variability in demand during the lead time. We use the standard deviation of the demand during the lead time to calculate this:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Standard deviation of demand during lead time} = 5 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n   The safety stock is typically calculated as a multiple of the standard deviation of the demand during the lead time. A common value for this multiple is 1.65 (which corresponds to a 95% service level). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ safety stock} = 1.65 \\times 5 = 8.25 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n   Since we can't order a fraction of a bottle, we round this to the nearest whole number, which is 8 bottles.\n\n4. **Calculate the Reorder Point:**\n   The Reorder Point (R) is the sum of the expected demand during the lead time and the safety stock:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Reorder Point} = \\text{Expected demand during lead time} + \\text{ safety stock} = 40 + 8 = 48 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the order quantity:**\n   The current inventory policy is to order 200 bottles when the quantity on hand drops below 45. This order quantity is not directly relevant to the Reorder Point calculation but is provided as additional information. The Reorder Point is still 48 bottles.\n\nTherefore, the recommended Reorder Point for Door Red is \\boxed{48}.",
            "To determine the recommended reorder point for DoorRed, we need to consider both the service level and the cost implications of understocking. The service level is typically defined by the desired probability of not running out of inventory before demand arrives, but in this problem, we can use the service level that corresponds to the order quantity and the lead time.\n\nThe reorder point is calculated as the average demand during the lead time plus a safety stock. The safety stock is the additional inventory kept on hand to account for variability in demand during the lead time.\n\n1. **Calculate the average demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 1 day, and the average daily demand is 40 bottles. Therefore, the average demand during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   40 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is determined by the desired service level. Since the problem does not specify a service level, we will assume a service level that corresponds to the order quantity minus the lead time, which is 200 bottles - 40 bottles = 160 bottles. This means we want to have enough inventory to cover the demand during the lead time plus a bit more to account for variability. A common approach is to use a z-score for the desired service level. For a service level of 95%, the z-score is approximately 1.645.\n\n   The standard deviation of the demand during the lead time is the same as the standard deviation of the daily demand, which is 5 bottles. Therefore, the safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   1.645 \\times 5 = 8.225 \\approx 9 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the reorder point:**\n   The reorder point is the sum of the average demand during the lead time and the safety stock:\n   \\[\n   40 + 9 = 49 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the recommended reorder point for DoorRed is \\(\\boxed{49}\\).",
            "To determine the recommended reorder point for Carred, we need to consider both the service level and the cost of understocking. The service level is typically set to meet customer service targets, but in this problem, we can focus on the point where the inventory level is such that there is a balance between the cost of holding inventory and the cost of lost sales due to stockouts.\n\nThe reorder point (R) is calculated as the sum of the average demand during the lead time and the safety stock. The lead time is one day, so the average demand during the lead time is 40 bottles. The safety stock is calculated based on the desired service level, but since the service level is not specified, we will focus on the point where the inventory level is such that there is a balance between the cost of holding inventory and the cost of lost sales.\n\nThe cost of holding inventory is given by the holding cost per bottle times the average inventory level. The holding cost per bottle is \\$4 \\times 0.25 = \\$1. The average inventory level is the sum of the safety stock and the lead time demand, which is 40 + safety stock. The cost of lost sales is \\$1.50 per bottle.\n\nTo find the safety stock, we need to determine the service level that balances the cost of holding inventory and the cost of lost sales. A common approach is to use the service level that corresponds to a certain service probability, such as 95%. For a normal distribution with a mean of 40 and a standard deviation of 5, the z-score for a 95% service level is approximately 1.645. The safety stock is then calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ safety stock} = 1.645 \\times 5 = 8.225 \\approx 9 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nSo, the reorder point is:\n\n\\[ R = 40 + 9 = 49 \\]\n\nHowever, since Carred orders 200 bottles when the quantity on hand drops below 45, we need to check if this point is reasonable. The current inventory policy is to order 200 bottles when the quantity on hand drops below 45, which means the reorder point should be set such that when the inventory drops to 45, a new order is placed. This means the safety stock is actually 45 - 40 = 5 bottles. The safety stock of 5 bottles corresponds to a service level of approximately 84%. For a service level of 84%, the z-score is approximately 1. The safety stock is then calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ safety stock} = 1 \\times 5 = 5 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nSo, the reorder point is:\n\n\\[ R = 40 + 5 = 45 \\]\n\nTherefore, the recommended reorder point for Carred is \\boxed{45}.",
            "To determine the recommended reorder point for Door Red, we need to consider both the lead time demand and the cost of understocking. The lead time demand is normally distributed with a mean of 40 bottles and a standard deviation of 5 bottles. Since the replenishment lead time is one day, the lead time demand is simply the mean and standard deviation of the daily demand.\n\nThe current inventory policy is to order 200 bottles when the quantity on hand drops below 45. This means the current policy is to order when the inventory falls to 45 bottles. However, we need to determine if this is the optimal point, considering the cost of understocking.\n\nThe cost of understocking is the lost sales revenue plus the holding cost of the bottles that are held in inventory. The lost sales revenue is the discount given to customers, which is \\$1.50 per bottle. The holding cost is 25% of the cost of the bottles, which is \\$1.00 per bottle.\n\nLet's denote the reorder point by \\( R \\). The safety stock is the amount of inventory held to cover the lead time demand plus some extra to account for the variability in the demand. The safety stock \\( S \\) can be calculated using the service level approach. The service level is the probability that the demand during the lead time will not exceed the safety stock.\n\nThe service level can be found using the standard normal distribution. We need to find the z-score corresponding to the service level that balances the holding cost and the cost of understocking. The z-score can be found using the formula for the service level \\( S \\):\n\n\\[ S = 1 - \\frac{\\text{ holding cost}}{\\text{cost of understocking}} = 1 - \\frac{0.25 \\times 4}{1.50} = 1 - \\frac{1}{1.50} = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.3333 \\]\n\nThe z-score corresponding to a service level of 0.3333 is approximately -0.43. This means that the safety stock \\( S \\) is 0.43 standard deviations above the mean lead time demand. Since the standard deviation of the daily demand is 5 bottles, the safety stock is:\n\n\\[ S = 0.43 \\times 5 = 2.15 \\approx 2 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the safety stock is 2 bottles. The reorder point \\( R \\) is the lead time demand plus the safety stock:\n\n\\[ R = 40 + 2 = 42 \\]\n\nHowever, the current policy is to order when the inventory falls to 45 bottles. This means the current policy is to order when the inventory is at or above 45 bottles, which is higher than the calculated safety stock. This suggests that the current policy is already optimal, and we should not adjust it.\n\nTherefore, the recommended reorder point for Door Red is:\n\n\\boxed{45}",

            "To determine how many discs the retailer expects to sell, we need to consider the quantity flexibility contract and the market demand distribution. The supplier and the retailer will enter into a quantity flexibility contract, which means the supplier can adjust the quantity of compact discs it supplies to the retailer. The retailer will order 1,017 units under this contract.\n\nGiven that the market demand is normally distributed with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 300, we can use the properties of the normal distribution to find the expected number of discs the retailer will sell. Since the retailer will order 1,017 units, the expected number of discs sold will be the minimum of the quantity ordered and the quantity sold, which in this case is the quantity ordered because the quantity ordered is greater than the mean demand.\n\nThe expected number of discs sold by the retailer is simply the quantity ordered because the contract ensures that the retailer will not sell more than the quantity ordered.

            "To determine how many discs the retailer expects to sell, we need to consider the quantity flexibility contract and the market demand distribution. The supplier and the retailer will adjust the order quantity to ensure the retailer sells a desired number of units. Here, the retailer decides to place an order for 1,017 units.\n\nThe market demand for compact discs is normally distributed with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 300. The retailer's order quantity of 1,017 units is above the mean demand of 1,000 units. To find out how many units the retailer expects to sell, we need to calculate the probability that the market demand is less than or equal to 1,017 units and then use this probability to find the expected number of units sold.\n\nFirst, we calculate the z-score for the demand of 1,017 units:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{1017 - 1000}{300} = \\frac{17}{300} \\approx 0.0567\n\\]\nUsing the standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find the cumulative probability corresponding to this z-score. The cumulative probability for \\(z = 0.0567\\) is approximately 0.523. This means that there is a 52.3% chance that the market demand will be less than or equal to 1,017 units.\n\nSince the retailer will only sell up to the number of units ordered, the expected number of units sold is the same as the number of units ordered, which is 1,017.

            "To determine the maximal expected profit for the manager at Sportmart, we need to consider the cost of purchasing skis, the revenue from selling them, and the cost of holding them in inventory. We will use the newsv method ( enumerate and select) to find the optimal order quantity that maximizes the expected profit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - \\( Q \\): Number of pairs of skis ordered.\n   - \\( \\mu \\): Mean demand = 350 pairs.\n   - \\( \\sigma \\): Standard deviation of demand = 100 pairs.\n   - \\( c \\): Cost per pair of skis = \\$100.\n   - \\( p \\): selling price per pair of skis = \\$250.\n   - \\( v \\): residue value per pair of skis = \\$85.\n   - \\( h \\): holding cost per pair of skis = \\$5.\n\n2. **Expected Profit Function:**\n   The expected profit \\( E[\\text{Profit}] \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Profit}] = E[\\text{Revenue}] - E[\\text{Cost}]\n   \\]\n   where:\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Revenue}] = Q \\cdot p - \\text{Expected holding cost}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Cost}] = Q \\cdot c + \\text{Expected holding cost}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expected Revenue:**\n   The revenue from selling \\( Q \\) pairs of skis is:\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Revenue}] = Q \\cdot p\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expected Cost:**\n   The cost of purchasing \\( Q \\) pairs of skis is:\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Cost}] = Q \\cdot c\n   \\]\n\n5. **Expected holding cost:**\n   The expected holding cost is the cost of holding the unsold skis at the end of the season. Let \\( D \\) be the demand, which is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\). The expected number of unsold skis is \\( Q - D \\) if \\( Q > D \\) and 0 if \\( Q \\leq D \\). The expected holding cost is:\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{ hold cost}] = \\int_0^Q (Q - x) \\cdot f(x) \\, dx\n   \\]\n   where \\( f(x) \\) is the normal probability density function.\n\n6. **Expected holding cost simplification:**\n   For a normal distribution with mean \\( \\mu \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\), the expected holding cost can be approximated using the critical value \\( Q^* \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   Q^* = \\mu + z \\cdot \\sigma\n   \\]\n   where \\( z \\) is the standard normal deviate corresponding to the desired service level. The service level is typically chosen to balance between overage and inventory holding costs.\n\n7. **Determine the optimal \\( Q^* \\):**\n   We need to find \\( z \\) such that the service level is maximized. This can be done using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator. For simplicity, we will use a service level of 95% ( corresponds to \\( z = 1.645 \\)).\n\n   \\[\n   Q^* = 350 + 1.645 \\cdot 100 = 514.5\n   \\]\n\n8. **Calculate the expected profit:**\n   Using \\( Q^* = 515 \\) (rounding to the nearest whole number):\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Revenue}] = 515 \\cdot 250 = 128750\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Cost}] = 515 \\cdot 100 = 51500\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{ holding cost}] = 515 \\cdot 5 = 2575\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Profit}] = 128750 - 51500 - 2575 = 74675\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximal expected profit is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{74675}\n\\]",
            "To determine the maximal expected profit, we need to consider the costs and revenues associated with different levels of production and sales. The profit function depends on the number of skis produced, the demand, and the costs and revenues associated with overproduction and underproduction.\n\nLet \\( Q \\) be the number of pairs of skis produced. The profit function \\( \\Pi(Q, D) \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\Pi(Q, D) = \\begin{cases} \n250D + 85(Q - D) - 5(Q - D) - 100Q & \\text{if } D \\leq Q \\\\\n250Q - 5Q - 100Q & \\text{if } D > Q \n\\end{cases} \\]\nwhere \\( D \\) is the demand. Simplifying the profit function, we get:\n\\[ \\Pi(Q, D) = \\begin{cases} \n135D - 5Q & \\text{if } D \\leq Q \\\\\n150Q - 100Q & \\text{if } D > Q \n\\end{cases} \\]\n\\[ \\Pi(Q, D) = \\begin{cases} \n135D - 5Q & \\text{if } D \\leq Q \\\\\n150Q - 100Q & \\text{if } D > Q \n\\end{cases} \\]\n\\[ \\Pi(Q, D) = \\begin{cases} \n135D - 5Q & \\text{if } D \\leq Q \\\\\n50Q & \\text{if } D > Q \n\\end{cases} \\]\n\nThe expected profit \\( E[\\Pi(Q)] \\) is the expected value of the profit function over the distribution of demand \\( D \\). The expected profit can be written as:\n\\[ E[\\Pi(Q)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} (135d - 5q) f(d) \\, dx + \\int_{Q}^{\\infty} 50q f(d) \\, dx \\]\nwhere \\( f(d) \\) is the normal distribution with mean \\( \\mu = 350 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 100 \\).\n\nTo find the optimal \\( Q \\), we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that maximizes the expected profit. This can be done by setting the derivative of the expected profit function with respect to \\( Q \\) to zero and solving for \\( Q \\).\n\nUsing the critical value approach, we find the critical value \\( Q^* \\) such that the probability of demand being less than or equal to \\( Q^* \\) is equal to the ratio of the cost of holding inventory to the sum of the revenue from selling a unit and the cost of holding a unit:\n\\[ P(D \\leq Q^*) = \\frac{100 + 5}{250 - 85} = \\frac{105}{165} = \\frac{7}{11} \\]\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table, we find the z-score corresponding to the cumulative probability of \\( \\frac{7}{11} \\):\n\\[ P(Z \\leq z) = \\frac{7}{11} \\approx 0.6364 \\]\n\\[ z \\approx 0.33 \\]\n\nThe corresponding value of \\( Q^* \\) is:\n\\[ Q^* = \\mu + z \\sigma = 350 + 0.33 \\times 100 = 383 \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximal expected profit is achieved when \\( Q = 383 \\). The expected profit can be calculated as:\n\\[ E[\\Pi(383)] = 135 \\times 350 \\times 0.6364 + 50 \\times 383 \\times 0.3636 = 30882.9 + 7038.3 = 37921.2 \\]\n\nThus, the maximal expected profit is:\n\\[ \\boxed{37921.2} \\]",

Also,\n\n\\[\nE[\\max(Q - D, 0)] = (Q - \\mu) \\Phi(z) + \\sigma \\phi(z)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into the expected profit equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nE[\\text{Profit}] = 250 \\left( \\mu + \\sigma \\left( \\frac{\\phi(z)}{1 - \\Phi(z)} \\right) \\right) - 100Q - 5 \\left( (Q - \\mu) \\Phi(z) + \\sigma \\phi(z) \\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n\\[\nE[\\text{Profit}] = 250 \\mu + 250 \\sigma \\left( \\frac{\\phi(z)}{1 - \\Phi(z)} \\right) - 100Q - 5Q + 5\\mu \\Phi(z) - 5\\sigma \\phi(z)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nE[\\text{Profit}] = 250 \\mu + 5\\mu \\Phi(z) + 250 \\sigma \\left( \\frac{\\phi(z)}{1 - \\Phi(z)} \\right) - 105Q - 5\\sigma \\phi(z)\n\\]\n\nTo find the optimal \\( Q \\), we need to maximize this expression. The optimal \\( Q \\) is the one that balances the cost of holding inventory with the revenue from sales. This is typically found by setting the expected profit maximization condition, which involves finding the value of \\( Q \\) such that the marginal cost of holding an additional unit equals the marginal revenue from selling that unit.\n\nUsing the critical value approach for the normal distribution, we find that the optimal \\( Q \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nQ = \\mu + \\sigma \\Phi^{-1}(p - c + 5)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values \\( \\mu = 350 \\), \\( \\sigma = 100 \\), \\( p = 250 \\), \\( c = 100 \\), and \\( 5 = 5 \\):\n\n\\[\nQ = 350 + 100 \\Phi^{-1}(250 - 100 + 5) = 350 + 100 \\Phi^{-1}(155)\n\\]\n\nUsing a standard normal table or calculator, we find that \\( \\Phi^{-1}(0.95) \\approx 1.645 \\):\n\n\\[\nQ = 350 + 100 \\times 1.645 = 350 + 164.5 = 514.5\n\\]\n\nSince we can't purchase a fraction of a pair of skis, we round to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the optimal number of skis to purchase is \\( Q = 515 \\).\n\nThe maximal expected profit is then calculated by substituting \\( Q = 515 \\) back into the expected profit formula, but for simplicity, we can use the fact that the optimal \\( Q \\) maximizes the expected profit. The exact calculation of the expected profit is complex and typically requires numerical methods or simulation, but the optimal \\( Q \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{515}\n\\]",
            "To determine the maximal expected profit, we need to find the optimal number of skis \\( n \\) to purchase that maximizes the expected profit. The expected profit function can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = n(p - c) - n \\cdot h - n \\cdot i \\]\nwhere \\( p = 250 \\) is the retail price, \\( c = 100 \\) is the purchase price, \\( h = 5 \\) is the holding cost per pair, and \\( i = 100 - 85 = 15 \\) is the loss per pair if the skis are not sold.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = n(250 - 100 - 5 - 15) = n(120) \\]\n\nHowever, we need to consider the probability that the demand will be less than or equal to \\( n \\).

The optimal \\( n \\) is the one that maximizes the expected profit. This is typically found by setting the expected demand equal to the critical value of the normal distribution that corresponds to the optimal service level.\n\nThe service level is given by the ratio of the profit per unit to the sum of the profit per unit and the holding cost per unit:\n\n\\[ \\text{Service level} = \\frac{p - c - h}{p - c - i} = \\frac{250 - 100 - 5 - 15}{250 - 100 - 5 - 15} = \\frac{120}{120} = 1 \\]\n\nThis means we should order enough skis to meet 100% of the demand, which is the mean demand. Therefore, the optimal number of skis to purchase is \\( n = 350 \\).\n\nThe expected profit is then:\n\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = 350 \\cdot 120 = 42000 \\]\n\nThus, the maximal expected profit is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42000} \\]",

The supplier's total cost is the sum of the cost of the units and the quantity flexibility cost. The supplier sells 1,017 units to the retailer, so the cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = 1 \\times 1017 + 0.05 \\times 1017 = 1017 + 50.85 = 1067.85\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost for the music store:**\n   The music store sells each disc to the retailer at \\$5.

            "To determine the cost of understocking that justifies Monson Kitchens' current inventory policy, we need to calculate the total cost of understocking and compare it to the total cost of the policy. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Calculate the average weekly demand and the lead time demand:**\n   - Weekly demand = 3,000 doors\n   - lead time = 2 weeks\n   - lead time demand = 3,000 * 2 = 6,000 doors\n\n2. **Determine the safety stock:**\n   - The safety stock is the additional inventory kept to account for variability in demand during the lead time. For a normal distribution, a common approach is to use a certain number of standard deviations (Z) to determine the safety stock. However, since the problem does not specify a service level, we will assume a service level that corresponds to the current policy of ordering when the inventory drops to 7,500 doors. This means the safety stock is the difference between the current inventory and the lead time demand when the inventory drops to zero.\n   - Current inventory = 7,500 doors\n   - safety stock = 7,500 - 6,000 = 1,500 doors\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the policy:**\n   - The cost of understocking is the cost of not having enough doors to meet demand. This cost is the holding cost of the safety stock.\n   - holding cost per door per year = 22% of \u20ac14 = 0.22 * \u20ac14 = \u20ac3.08\n   - total holding cost = safety stock * holding cost per door = 1,500 * \u20ac3.08 = \u20ac4,620\n\n4. **Determine the cost of understocking:**\n   - The cost of understocking is the holding cost of the safety stock, which is \u20ac4,620.\n\nTherefore, the cost of understocking that justifies Monson Kitchens' current inventory policy is \\boxed{4620}.",
            "To determine the cost of under stock, we need to calculate the total cost of under stock per year. This involves calculating the expected holding cost and the expected back orders cost per year.\n\nFirst, let's determine the average inventory level and the lead time demand. The manager orders 11,000 doors when the inventory drops to 7,500 doors, which means the lead time demand is 7,500 doors. The lead time is 2 weeks, and the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 3,000 doors and a standard deviation of 550 doors. Therefore, the lead time demand is also normally distributed with a mean of \\(2 \\times 3,000 = 6,000\\) doors and a standard deviation of \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times 550 \\approx 777.83\\) doors.\n\nThe safety stock is the difference between the lead time demand and the inventory level when the order is placed. So, the safety stock is \\(6,000 - 7,500 = -1,500\\) doors. Since the safety stock cannot be negative, it means the manager is not accounting for any safety stock, and the policy is a no-hold policy with a lead time demand of 6,000 doors.\n\nThe average inventory level is the safety stock plus the lead time demand, which is \\(6,000\\) doors. The holding cost is 22% of the cost of the doors. The cost of each door is \u20ac14, so the holding cost per door is \\(0.22 \\times 14 = 3.08\\) euros. Therefore, the total holding cost per year is:\n\\[6,000 \\times 3.08 = 18,480 \\text{ euros}.\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the expected back orders cost. The expected back orders cost is the expected value of the back orders per week times the number of weeks in a year. The expected back orders per week is the expected value of the difference between the lead time demand and the current inventory level. Since the current inventory level is 7,500 doors and the lead time demand is normally distributed with a mean of 6,000 doors, the expected back orders per week is:\n\\[6,000 - 7,500 = -1,500 \\text{ doors}.\\]\nSince the safety stock cannot be negative, the expected back orders per week is 0 doors. Therefore, the expected back orders cost per year is:\n\\[0 \\times 52 = 0 \\text{ euros}.\\]\n\nThe total cost of under stock per year is the sum of the holding cost and the back orders cost:\n\\[18,480 + 0 = 18,480 \\text{ euros}.\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of under stock is \\(\\boxed{18480}\\).",
            "To determine the cost of understocking that justifies Monson Kitchens' current inventory policy, we need to calculate the total cost associated with holding inventory and the cost of understocking. The manager's current policy is to order 11,000 doors when the inventory drops to 7,500 doors. This means that the average inventory is (7,500 + 0) / 2 = 7,500 doors. The replenishment lead time is two weeks, so the average lead time is 2 weeks.\n\nFirst, we calculate the average number of doors sold during the lead time. Since the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 3,000 doors, the average demand during the lead time is 2 * 3,000 = 6,000 doors. The current policy implies that the manager is ordering 11,000 doors to ensure that the average inventory does not fall below 7,500 doors. This means that the manager is trying to keep the inventory at a level that covers the lead time demand plus some safety stock, which in this case is 11,000 - 6,000 = 5,000 doors.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of holding inventory. The holding cost is 22% of the cost of the doors. The cost of each door is \u20ac14, so the holding cost per door is 0.22 * \u20ac14 = \u20ac3.08. The average inventory is 7,500 doors, so the average holding cost is 7,500 * \u20ac3.08 = \u20ac23,100.\n\nNow, we need to determine the cost of understocking. The manager's policy is to order 11,000 doors when the inventory drops to 7,500 doors, which means the manager is ordering 5,000 doors more than the lead time demand. The safety stock is 5,000 doors. The cost of understocking is the cost of the doors that are not sold due to stockouts. The cost of each door is \u20ac14, so the cost of understocking is \u20ac14 * 5,000 = \u20ac70,000.\n\nThe total cost of the policy is the sum of the holding cost and the cost of understocking. The holding cost is \u20ac23,100, and the cost of understocking is \u20ac70,000, so the total cost is \u20ac23,100 + \u20ac70,000 = \u20ac93,100.\n\nTherefore, the cost of understocking that justifies the manager's current inventory policy is \\boxed{70000}.",

Since the policy is to order 11,000 doors when the inventory drops to 7,500 doors, the number of doors that are under stock is \\(11,000 - 7,500 = 3,500\\) doors.\n   - The cost of each door is \u20ac14, so the cost of understocking is \\(3,500 \\times 14 = 49,000\\) euros.\n\n5. **Calculate the holding cost:**\n   - The holding cost is the cost of holding the inventory. The average inventory is the back orders plus half of the safety stock, which is \\(\\frac{6,000 + 1,500}{2} = 3,750\\) doors.\n   - The holding cost rate is 22%, so the holding cost is \\(3,750 \\times 14 \\times 0.22 = 11,325\\) euros.\n\n6. **Determine the cost of understocking relative to the holding cost:**\n   - The cost of understocking is the additional cost incurred by not having enough inventory to meet the demand. Since the holding cost is \u20ac11,325 and the cost of understocking is \u20ac49,000, the cost of understocking is \\(\\frac{49,000}{11,325} \\approx 4.34\\) times the holding cost.\n\nTherefore, the cost of understocking that justifies the manager's current inventory policy is \\(\\boxed{49000}\\) euros.",

The z-score \\( z \\) can be found from the standard normal distribution table for a given service level \\( S \\).\n\nThe current policy is to order 11,000 doors when the inventory drops to 7,500 doors.

For a 95% service level, the Z-score is approximately 1.645.\n   \\[\n   \\text{ safety stock} = 1.645 \\times 550 \\times \\sqrt{2} = 1.645 \\times 550 \\times 1.414 \\approx 1236 \\text{ doors}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total inventory level:**\n   The total inventory level is the sum of the average lead time demand and the safety stock:\n   \\[\n   6000 + 1236 = 7236 \\text{ doors}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the service level and the probability of stockout:**\n   The service level is the probability that the inventory will not run out before the next order.

            "To determine the expected profit for VideoRUs, we need to follow a series of steps to calculate the optimal ordering size and then the expected profit. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the OptimalOrdering Size\nThe optimal ordering size \\( Q \\) can be found using the newpoint order quantity formula for the newsboy problem with price discriminates. However, for simplicity and given the complexity of the exact formula, we can use the newpoint approximation for the newsboy problem with a normal distribution of demand.\n\nThe newsboy model with price discriminates can be approximated by the following formula:\n\\[ Q = \\mu + z \\sigma \\]\nwhere:\n- \\(\\mu\\) is the mean demand,\n- \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of demand,\n- \\(z\\) is the standard normal deviate corresponding to the desired service level.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the service level. The service level is the probability that demand will not exceed the ordering quantity. For a given profit, we need to find the service level that balances the cost of overage and cost of shortfall.\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\mu = 10,000\\)\n- \\(\\sigma = 5,000\\)\n- Cost per DVD = \\$10\n- Selling price per DVD = \\$19.99\n- Discounted price per DVD = \\$4.99\n- Marginal production cost = \\$1\n\nThe critical ratio ( service level) is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Critical ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Selling price} - \\text{Cost}}{\\text{Selling price} - \\text{Discounted price}} = \\frac{19.99 - 1}{19.99 - 4.99} = \\frac{18.99}{15} \\approx 1.266 \\]\n\nHowever, this critical ratio is not feasible since it exceeds 1. This suggests that the optimal ordering quantity should be at the point where the cost of overage equals the cost of shortfall. Given the problem's constraints, we can use the newpoint approximation directly.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Expected Profit\nThe expected profit can be calculated using the following formula:\n\\[ \\text{Expected profit} = (\\text{Selling price} - \\text{Cost}) \\times \\text{Expected units sold} - \\text{Marginal cost} \\times \\text{Order quantity} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to find the expected units sold. Since the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 10,000 and a standard deviation of 5,000, and we are ordering at the optimal quantity \\( Q \\), the expected units sold is simply \\( Q \\).\n\nLet's assume the optimal ordering quantity \\( Q \\) is found to be 12,000 (this is an approximation based on the critical ratio and the newpoint formula).\n\nNow, we calculate the expected profit:\n\\[ \\text{Expected profit} = (19.99 - 10) \\times 12,000 - 1 \\times 12,000 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Expected profit} = 9.99 \\times 12,000 - 12,000 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Expected profit} = 119,880 - 12,000 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Expected profit} = 107,880 \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected profit for VideoRUs is \\(\\boxed{107880}\\).",
            "To determine the expected profit for VideoRUs, we need to calculate the optimal ordering quantity for the movie store and then determine the expected profit based on the demand distribution.\n\nFirst, we calculate the critical ratio, which is the ratio of the profit per unit above the cost to the total cost. The profit per unit sold is \\$19.99 - \\$10 = \\$9.99, and the cost per unit is \\$10. Therefore, the critical ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Critical ratio} = \\frac{9.99}{9.99 + 1} = \\frac{9.99}{10.99} \\approx 0.91\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the corresponding quantile of the normal distribution for this critical ratio. The demand is normally distributed with a mean of 10,000 and a standard deviation of 5,000. We use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.91. This z-score is approximately 1.34.\n\nThe optimal ordering quantity is then calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Optimal ordering quantity} = \\text{Mean} + z \\times \\text{Standard deviation} = 10000 + 1.34 \\times 5000 = 10000 + 6700 = 16700\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the expected profit. The expected profit is the revenue from selling the DVDs minus the cost of ordering them. The revenue is the selling price times the number of DVDs sold, and the cost is the ordering cost times the number of DVDs ordered.\n\nThe expected number of DVDs sold is the mean demand, which is 10,000. Therefore, the expected revenue is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected revenue} = 10000 \\times 19.99 = 199900\n\\]\n\nThe expected cost is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected cost} = 16700 \\times 1 = 16700\n\\]\n\nThe expected profit is then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected profit} = 199900 - 16700 = 183200\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected profit for VideoRUs is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{183200}\n\\]",

The expected number of DVDs sold at the regular price is the mean of the normal distribution minus the number of DVDs sold at the discounted price. However, since the problem does not specify the exact number of DVDs sold at each price, we assume that all DVDs are sold at the regular price to maximize profit.\n\nThus, the total profit from selling the DVDs to customers is:\n\\[ \\text{Total profit from customers} = 10,000 \\times \\$18.99 = \\$189,900 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Sum the profits from both segments to get the total profit\n\nThe total profit is the sum of the profit from selling the DVDs to PrintRUs and the profit from selling the DVDs to customers:\n\\[ \\text{Total profit} = \\$189,900 + \\$189,900 = \\$379,800 \\]\n\nTherefore, the profit that the studio makes given PrintRUs\u2019 optimal ordering actions is:\n\\[ \\boxed{379800} \\]",
