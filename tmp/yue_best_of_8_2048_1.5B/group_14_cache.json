Let's define the variables and the profit function step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( Q \\) be the number of compact discs the retailer orders.\n   - Let \\( D \\) be the random variable representing the market demand, which is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 1000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 300 \\).\n\n2. **Revenue and Cost Structure:**\n   - The retailer buys each disc from the supplier for \\$1.\n   - The retailer sells each disc to the end consumer for \\$10.\n   - The retailer is charged \\$1 per disc under the revenue sharing contract.\n   - The manufacturer gets 45% of the retail revenue, which is \\$4.50 per disc sold.\n   - The retailer keeps \\$5.50 per disc after paying the manufacturer.\n\n3. **Profit Calculation:**\n   - If the retailer sells \\( \\min(Q, D) \\) discs, the revenue is \\( 10 \\times \\min(Q, D) \\).\n   - The cost to the retailer is \\( 1 \\times Q + 1 \\times \\min(Q, D) \\).\n   - The profit for the retailer is \\( 10 \\times \\min(Q, D) - (1 \\times Q + 1 \\times \\min(Q, D)) = 9 \\times \\min(Q, D) - Q \\).\n\n4. **Expected Profit:**\n   - The expected profit is \\( E[9 \\times \\min(Q, D) - Q] = 9 \\times E[\\min(Q, D)] - Q \\).\n   - We need to find \\( E[\\min(Q, D)] \\), which is the expected value of the minimum of \\( Q \\) and \\( D \\).\n\n5. **Expected Value of the Minimum:**\n   - For a normal distribution \\( D \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2) \\), the expected value of the minimum of \\( Q \\) and \\( D \\) can be approximated using the properties of the normal distribution.\n   - The expected value of \\( \\min(Q, D) \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     E[\\min(Q, D)] = \\mu - \\sigma \\frac{\\phi(\\alpha)}{1 - \\Phi(\\alpha)}\n     \\]\n     where \\( \\alpha = \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\), \\( \\phi \\) is the standard normal density function, and \\( \\Phi \\) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.\n   - Here, \\( \\alpha = \\frac{Q - 1000}{300} \\).\n\n6. **Optimal Order Quantity:**\n   - To find the optimal \\( Q \\), we need to maximize the expected profit function \\( 9 \\times E[\\min(Q, D)] - Q \\).\n   - This can be done by taking the derivative of the expected profit with respect to \\( Q \\) and setting it to zero, or by using numerical methods to find the optimal \\( Q \\).\n\n7. ** Numerical Solution:**\n   - Using numerical methods or a normal distribution table, we can find the optimal \\( Q \\).\n   - For a normal distribution with mean 1000 and standard deviation 300, the optimal order quantity \\( Q \\) is approximately 1200.\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of compact discs the independent retailer should order is \\(\\boxed{1200}\\).",
            "To determine how many compact discs the retailer should order, we need to consider the expected profit and the cost of overage and underage. The key is to find the optimal order quantity that maximizes the expected profit.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables and the costs and revenues:\n- The cost per disc for the manufacturer is \\$1.\n- The revenue per disc for the retailer is \\$10.\n- The cost per disc for the retailer is \\$5.\n- The revenue per disc for the manufacturer after the revenue sharing contract is \\$4.50.\n- The market demand for compact discs is normally distributed with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 300.\n\nThe profit for the retailer per disc sold is the revenue minus the cost, which is \\$10 - \\$5 = \\$5. The profit for the manufacturer per disc sold is \\$4.50 - \\$1 = \\$3.50. If the retailer orders \\( Q \\) discs, the expected profit for the retailer can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe expected profit for the retailer is the sum of the profit from selling \\( Q \\) discs and the expected profit from the remaining demand. The expected profit from the remaining demand is the profit from the remaining demand minus the cost of the unsold discs.\n\nLet \\( X \\) be the random variable representing the demand for compact discs. The expected profit for the retailer is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected Profit} = 5Q + \\mathbb{E}[(X - Q)^+ (10 - 5 - 1)] \\]\nwhere \\( (X - Q)^+ \\) is the positive part of \\( X - Q \\), representing the unsold discs.\n\nThe expected profit from the remaining demand can be simplified using the properties of the normal distribution. The expected value of the remaining demand is \\( \\mathbb{E}[(X - Q)^+ (5)] = 5 \\mathbb{E}[(X - Q)^+] \\). The expected value of the remaining demand is the expected value of the truncated normal distribution, which can be calculated using the standard normal distribution.\n\nThe optimal order quantity \\( Q \\) is the point where the marginal cost of ordering an additional disc equals the marginal revenue from selling an additional disc. This point can be found by setting the expected profit to a maximum and solving for \\( Q \\).\n\nUsing the properties of the normal distribution and the revenue sharing contract, the optimal order quantity \\( Q \\) is approximately 1,000 discs. This is because the expected demand is 1,000 and the standard deviation is 300, so the optimal order quantity is close to the mean of the demand distribution.\n\nTherefore, the number of discs the retailer should order is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\]",

            "To determine how many compact discs an independent retailer should order, we need to maximize the expected profit. Let's denote the number of compact discs ordered by the retailer as \\( Q \\).\n\nThe profit for the retailer can be broken down into two parts: the revenue from selling the compact discs and the cost of ordering them. The revenue from selling \\( Q \\) compact discs at \\$10 each is \\( 10Q \\). The cost of ordering \\( Q \\) compact discs at \\$1 each is \\( Q \\). However, the retailer is charged \\$1 per disc by the supplier under the revenue sharing contract, so the cost to the retailer is \\( Q \\). The manufacturer gets 45% of the retail revenue, which is \\( 0.45 \\times 10Q = 4.5Q \\), and keeps the remaining 55%, which is \\( 0.55 \\times 10Q = 5.5Q \\). Therefore, the retailer's net revenue from the manufacturer is \\( 5.5Q \\).\n\nThe expected profit for the retailer can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\text{Expected Profit} = 10Q - Q + 5.5Q - Q = 13.5Q - Q = 12.5Q - \\text{Cost of overage} - \\text{Cost of shortage} \\]\n\nSince the retailer sells all the compact discs it has, there is no cost of shortage. However, there is a cost of overage, which is the cost of the compact discs that are not sold. The cost of overage is the cost to the retailer minus the revenue sharing percentage, which is \\( 10 - 1 - 5.5 = 3.5 \\) dollars per disc. The expected number of compact discs that will be sold is the expected demand, which is normally distributed with a mean of 1000 and a standard deviation of 300. The critical value for the optimal order quantity is the point where the expected profit is maximized.\n\nTo find this critical value, we need to solve for \\( Q \\) such that the expected profit is maximized. This can be done using the newsv approach, which involves finding the critical value from the standard normal distribution that corresponds to the desired service level. The service level is the probability that the demand will be met, which is the same as the probability that the demand will be less than or equal to the order quantity.\n\nThe critical value for the optimal order quantity is given by:\n\\[ Q = \\mu + z \\sigma \\]\nwhere \\( \\mu \\) is the mean demand, \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of demand, and \\( z \\) is the critical value from the standard normal distribution. The critical value \\( z \\) is found by solving the equation for the expected profit:\n\\[ 12.5Q - 3.5(Q - 1000) = 12.5Q - 3.5Q + 3500 = 9Q + 3500 \\]\nThe critical value \\( z \\) is the value that satisfies this equation. Using the standard normal distribution table, we find that the critical value \\( z \\) is approximately 1.28. Therefore, the optimal order quantity is:\n\\[ Q = 1000 + 1.28 \\times 300 = 1000 + 384 = 1384 \\]\n\nThus, the optimal number of compact discs the retailer should order is \\(\\boxed{1384}\\)."

            "To determine how many toys the retailer should send to the high buttons channel, we need to consider the probability that the demand will exceed the supply from the discount channel. Here is a step-by-step approach to solving the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the demand distribution**:\n   The demand for the toy at the high buttons channel is normally distributed with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 400,000 and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 150,000. This can be written as \\(D \\sim N(400,000, 150,000^2)\\).\n\n2. **Determine the supply from the discount channel**:\n   The manufacturer sends 100,000 toys to the retailer. Since the demand at the high buttons channel is normally distributed, the retailer will not be able to meet all the demand if the demand exceeds 100,000 toys. Therefore, we need to find the probability that the demand exceeds 100,000 toys and then determine how many toys should be sent to ensure the probability of meeting the demand is sufficiently high.\n\n3. **Calculate the z-score**:\n   The z-score for a value \\(x\\) in a normal distribution is given by:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n   \\]\n   For \\(x = 100,000\\), the z-score is:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{100,000 - 400,000}{150,000} = \\frac{-300,000}{150,000} = -2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the probability corresponding to the z-score**:\n   Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find the probability that a standard normal variable is less than -2. This probability is approximately 0.0228. Therefore, the probability that the demand exceeds 100,000 toys is:\n   \\[\n   P(D > 100,000) = 1 - P(D \\leq 100,000) = 1 - 0.9772 = 0.0228\n   \\]\n   This means there is a 2.28% chance that the demand will exceed the supply from the discount channel.\n\n5. **Determine the number of toys to send to the high buttons channel**:\n   To ensure that the retailer meets the demand with a high probability, we can send a number of toys equal to the mean demand plus a certain number of standard deviations. A common approach is to send the mean demand plus one standard deviation, which is a reasonable balance between meeting most of the demand and not over circumsizing the supply.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of toys to send} = \\mu + \\sigma = 400,000 + 150,000 = 550,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the retailer should send \\(\\boxed{550000}\\) toys to the high buttons channel.",

The retailer will send as many toys as the probability of demand exceeding the supply allows.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the probability that the demand will be less than or equal to the supply. The supply from the high-liter channel is the same as the total supply minus the supply to the discount channel. Since the discount channel sells out completely, the supply to the high-liter channel is the total supply minus the supply to the discount channel. However, since the problem does not specify the supply to the discount channel, we assume the retailer sends all the toys to the high-liter channel if the demand is within the supply range.\n\nGiven that the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 400,000 and a standard deviation of 150,000, we need to find the maximum number of toys that can be sent to the high-liter channel such that the probability of demand exceeding this number is minimized. Since the retailer sends 100,000 toys to the discount channel, the maximum number of toys that can be sent to the high-liter channel is the total supply minus the supply to the discount channel, which is 100,000 toys if the demand is less than or equal to 100,000 toys.\n\nHowever, since the demand is normally distributed, we need to find the number of toys that corresponds to a very high probability of demand not exceeding this number. A common approach is to use the inverse of the standard normal distribution to find the number of toys that corresponds to a very high probability (e.g., 99.99999999999999% of the time the demand is less than or equal to this number).\n\nFor a normal distribution with mean 400,000 and standard deviation 150,000, the number of toys that corresponds to a very high probability of demand not exceeding this number is approximately the mean plus a multiple of the standard deviation. For practical purposes, we can use the inverse of the standard normal distribution to find this number.\n\nUsing the inverse of the standard normal distribution, we find that the number of toys that corresponds to a very high probability of demand not exceeding this number is approximately 500,000 toys.\n\nTherefore, the retailer should send \\boxed{500000} toys to the high-liter channel.",

The retailer plans to sell the toy at a margin of \\$8 in the high-member channel, but this margin does not directly affect the number of toys to be sent to the high-member channel. Instead, it affects the profit per toy sold in the high-member channel, which is not relevant to the decision on the number of toys to be sent.\n\nThe critical factor here is the probability that the supply to the high-member channel will meet the demand. Since the supply is 100,000 toys and the forecasted demand is 400,000 toys with a standard deviation of 150,000, the retailer should send as many toys as the forecasted demand allows, which is 400,000 toys.

The expected demand is 400,000 toys, so the retailer should send at least 400,000 toys to the high names channel.\n\nTo confirm that this is the optimal number, we can consider the probability that the demand will be met. The probability that the demand will be less than or equal to 400,000 toys is very high because the mean demand is 400,000 and the standard deviation is 150,000.

The retailer plans to send 100,000 toys to the discount channel, which will sell out, so the remaining toys sent to the highertools channel will be the number of toys sent to the highertools channel minus 100,000.\n\nLet's denote the number of toys sent to the highertools channel as \\( x \\). The total number of toys sent to both channels is 100,000 + \\( x \\). Since the toys sent to the discount channel sell out, the toys sent to the highertools channel must meet the remaining demand. The probability that the demand at the highertools channel exceeds \\( x \\) is the probability that a normally distributed random variable with mean 400,000 and standard deviation 150,000 is greater than \\( x \\).\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( x \\) such that the probability that the demand is greater than \\( x \\) is minimized. This is equivalent to finding the value of \\( x \\) such that the probability that the demand is less than or equal to \\( x \\) is maximized.

Therefore, the number of toys sent to the highertools channel should be the expected demand minus the number of toys sent to the discount channel. The expected demand is 400,000, and the number of toys sent to the discount channel is 100,000. Therefore, the number of toys sent to the highertools channel is:\n\n\\[ x = 400,000 - 100,000 = 300,000 \\]\n\nThus, the retailer should send \\(\\boxed{300000}\\) toys to the highertools channel."

This involves calculating the expected profit for different order quantities and choosing the one that gives the highest expected profit.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- \\( Q \\) is the order quantity (the number of cakes ordered at the beginning of the two-month period).\n- \\( D \\) is the demand, which follows a normal distribution with mean \\( \\mu = 8000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 2000 \\).\n- The price per cake is \u20ac29 if sold at full price and \u20ac5 if sold at a discount.\n- The marginal production cost per cake is \u20ac2.50.\n- The discount price is \u20ac5, which is \u20ac29 - \u20ac24 = \u20ac5 less than the full price, so the profit per cake sold at a discount is \u20ac5 - \u20ac2.50 = \u20ac2.50.\n\nThe expected profit \\( E[\\pi] \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ E[\\pi] = E[\\text{Profit from full-price sales}] + E[\\text{Profit from discount sales}] \\]\n\\[ E[\\pi] = E[(29 - 2.50) \\min(Q, D)] + E[(5 - 2.50) \\max(0, Q - D)] \\]\n\\[ E[\\pi] = 26.50 E[\\min(Q, D)] + 2.50 E[\\max(0, Q - D)] \\]\n\nTo find the optimal \\( Q \\), we need to calculate the expected profit for different values of \\( Q \\) and choose the one that maximizes the expected profit. However, this is a complex calculation that typically requires numerical methods or simulation. For simplicity, we can use the critical value approach for the normal distribution.\n\nThe critical value \\( z \\) for the optimal order quantity is given by:\n\\[ z = \\frac{29 - 2.50}{2000} = \\frac{26.50}{2000} = 0.01325 \\]\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table, the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.5 - 0.01325 = 0.48675 is approximately 2.17. Therefore, the optimal order quantity \\( Q \\) is:\n\\[ Q = \\mu + z \\sigma = 8000 + 2.17 \\times 2000 = 8000 + 4340 = 12340 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the expected number of cakes sold at a discount. This is the expected value of the excess demand, which is the expected value of \\( \\max(0, Q - D) \\).\n\nThe expected value of \\( \\max(0, Q - D) \\) for a normal distribution is given by:\n\\[ E[\\max(0, Q - D)] = (Q - \\mu) \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) + \\sigma \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) \\]\nwhere \\( \\Phi \\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution and \\( \\phi \\) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\\[ E[\\max(0, 12340 - D)] = (12340 - 8000) \\Phi\\left(\\frac{12340 - 8000}{2000}\\right) + 2000 \\phi\\left(\\frac{12340 - 8000}{2000}\\right) \\]\n\\[ E[\\max(0, 12340 - D)] = 4340 \\Phi(2.17) + 2000 \\phi(2.17) \\]\n\\[ E[\\max(0, 12340 - D)] = 4340 \\times 0.9850 + 2000 \\times 0.0195 \\]\n\\[ E[\\max(0, 12340 - D)] = 4250.9 + 39 \\]\n\\[ E[\\max(0, 12340 - D)] = 4289.9 \\approx 4290 \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected number of cakes sold at a discount is \\boxed{4290}.",
            "To determine the optimal order quantity and the expected number of cakes sold at a discount, we need to use the newsv method ( single period model with back ordering). This method helps us find the optimal service level that balances the cost of overage and the cost of backorder.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - \\( p \\): Selling price per cake = \u20ac29\n   - \\( c \\): Marginal production cost per cake = \u20ac2.50\n   - \\( s \\): Substiting price per cake = \u20ac5\n   - \\( \\mu \\): Mean demand = 8,000 cakes\n   - \\( \\sigma \\): Standard deviation of demand = 2,000 cakes\n\n2. **Calculate the Marginal Profit and Marginal Cost:**\n   - Marginal Profit = \\( p - c = 29 - 2.50 = \u20ac26.50 \\)\n   - Marginal Cost = \\( c = \u20ac2.50 \\)\n\n3. **Calculate the service level:**\n   The service level \\( F \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F = \\frac{p - c}{p - s} = \\frac{29 - 2.50}{29 - 5} = \\frac{26.50}{24} \\approx 1.1042\n   \\]\n   However, since the service level cannot be greater than 1, we need to find the closest value that is less than or equal to 1. The service level should be 1, which means we need to find the corresponding z-score for a cumulative probability of 1.\n\n4. **Determine the optimal order quantity:**\n   The optimal order quantity \\( Q \\) is found by solving for the z-score corresponding to the service level of 1. Since the service level of 1 corresponds to the mean demand, we need to find the z-score for the highest possible service level, which is the mean demand itself. Therefore, the optimal order quantity is the mean demand, which is 8,000 cakes.\n\n5. **Calculate the expected number of cakes sold at a discount:**\n   Since the optimal order quantity is 8,000 cakes and the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 8,000 and a standard deviation of 2,000, the probability of demand being less than 8,000 is 0.5. Therefore, the probability of demand being more than 8,000 is also 0.5. This means that the expected number of cakes sold at a discount is:\n   \\[\n   0.5 \\times 2,000 = 1,000\n   \\]\n\nThus, the expected number of cakes sold at a discount is \\(\\boxed{1000}\\)."

This is done by finding the point where the demand is equal to the production quantity, which is the point where the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution is 0.5 (since the optimal production quantity is the point where the demand is equal to the production quantity).\n\n4. **Calculate the Expected Profit:**\n   - The optimal production quantity \\( Q^* \\) is approximately 8,000 (since the mean of the demand is 8,000 and the standard deviation is 2,000, the optimal production quantity is around the mean).\n   - The expected profit is then calculated as:\n     \\[\n     E[\\pi] = (29 - 2.50) \\cdot 8000 + (5 - 2.50) \\cdot 0 = 26.50 \\cdot 8000 = 212000\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the profit that the confectioner makes, given M means optimal actions, is \\(\\boxed{212000}\\).",

We will use the newsv approach (single period newsv model) to solve this problem.\n\n1. **Identify the parameters:**\n   - Selling price per cake: \u20ac15\n   - Marginal cost per cake: \u20ac2.50\n   - Discounted price per cake: \u20ac5\n   - Mean demand: 8,000 cakes\n   - Standard deviation of demand: 2,000 cakes\n\n2. **Calculate the critical ratio:**\n   The critical ratio is the probability that a cake will be sold at the regular price. It is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Critical ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Selling price} - \\text{ Marginal cost}}{\\text{Selling price} - \\text{Discounted price}} = \\frac{15 - 2.50}{15 - 5} = \\frac{12.50}{10} = 1.25\n   \\]\n   Since the critical ratio is greater than 1, it means that the confectioner will always sell all the cakes at the regular price. This simplifies our problem to a single period newsv model.\n\n3. **Determine the optimal production quantity:**\n   The optimal production quantity in a newsv model is the mean demand plus the standard deviation of demand times the critical ratio of the demand distribution. However, since the critical ratio is greater than 1, we can simply produce the mean demand, which is 8,000 cakes.\n\n4. **Calculate the profit:**\n   The profit is calculated as the revenue from selling the cakes minus the production cost.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue} = 8000 \\times 15 = 120000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost} = 8000 \\times 2.50 = 20000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost} = 120000 - 20000 = 100000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the profit that the confectioner makes, given M means optimal actions, is \\(\\boxed{100000}\\).",
            "To determine the profit that the confectioner makes given M means optimal actions, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the break-even point in units:**\n   The break-even point is where the revenue equals the cost. The revenue per cake is \u20ac15 and the cost per cake is \u20ac2.50. Therefore, the break-even point is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Break-even point} = \\frac{\\text{Cost per cake}}{\\text{Selling price per cake} - \\text{Cost per cake}} = \\frac{2.50}{15 - 2.50} = \\frac{2.50}{12.50} = 0.2 \\text{ cakes}\n   \\]\n   Since we cannot sell a fraction of a cake, the confectioner needs to sell at least 1 cake to make a profit.\n\n2. **Determine the optimal order quantity:**\n   Since the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 8,000 and a standard deviation of 2,000, we need to find the optimal order quantity that maximizes the expected profit. This is typically done using the newspaper problem approach, which involves finding the critical ratio. The critical ratio is the probability that the demand will be met, which is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Critical ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Selling price} - \\text{Cost}}{\\text{Selling price} - \\text{Cost} + \\text{Discount price}} = \\frac{15 - 2.50}{15 - 2.50 + 5} = \\frac{12.50}{17.50} = 0.7143\n   \\]\n   Using the standard normal distribution table, we find that the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.7143 is approximately 0.57. Therefore, the optimal order quantity is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Optimal order quantity} = \\text{Mean} + \\text{Z-score} \\times \\text{Standard deviation} = 8000 + 0.57 \\times 2000 = 8000 + 1140 = 9140\n   \\]\n   Since we cannot order a fraction of a cake, we round this to the nearest whole number, which is 9140 cakes.\n\n3. **Calculate the expected profit:**\n   The expected profit is the revenue from selling the cakes minus the cost of producing them. The revenue is the selling price times the number of cakes sold, and the cost is the production cost times the number of cakes produced. The number of cakes sold is the minimum of the number of cakes produced and the demand. The expected profit is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit} = \\text{Expected revenue} - \\text{Expected cost} = \\left( \\text{Selling price} \\times \\min(\\text{Number of cakes produced}, \\text{Mean demand}) \\right) - \\left( \\text{Cost per cake} \\times \\text{Number of cakes produced} \\right)\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit} = \\left( 15 \\times 8000 \\right) - \\left( 2.50 \\times 9140 \\right) = 120000 - 22850 = 97150\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the profit that the confectioner makes, given M means optimal actions, is \\boxed{97150}."

Let's denote the price charged to the customer who is willing to place an order more than one week in advance as \\( p_1 \\) and the price charged to the customer who is willing to commit in advance as \\( p_2 \\).\n\nFirst, we need to find the revenue functions for each segment. The revenue for the first segment is given by:\n\\[ R_1 = p_1 \\times d_1 = p_1 \\times (5000 - 20p_1) = 5000p_1 - 20p_1^2. \\]\nThe revenue for the second segment is given by:\n\\[ R_2 = p_2 \\times d_2 = p_2 \\times (5000 - 40p_2) = 5000p_2 - 40p_2^2. \\]\n\nThe profit for each segment is the revenue minus the production cost.

The retailer's profit depends on whether the order quantity \\( O \\) meets or exceeds the demand, and if not, the leftover units can be sold at a silverings value of \\$25 each.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables and costs:\n- Production cost per unit: \\$20\n-Wholesale price per unit: \\$36\n-wholesale price per unit to customer: \\$55\n- Smaller loss for leftover units: \\$10\n- Smaller loss for leftover units: \\$10\n\nThe retailer's profit function can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = \\text{Revenue from sales} + \\text{Revenue from customer} - \\text{Total production cost} - \\text{Total loss from leftover units} \\]\n\nThe revenue from sales is:\n\\[ \\text{Revenue from sales} = 55 \\times \\min(O, D) \\]\nwhere \\( D \\) is the demand.\n\nThe revenue from the customer is:\n\\[ \\text{Revenue from customer} = 55 \\times O \\]\nif \\( O \\leq D \\), otherwise it is:\n\\[ \\text{Revenue from customer} = 55 \\times D \\]\n\nThe total production cost is:\n\\[ \\text{Total production cost} = 20 \\times O \\]\n\nThe total loss from leftover units is:\n\\[ \\text{Total loss from leftover units} = 10 \\times (O - D)^+ \\]\nwhere \\( (O - D)^+ = \\max(O - D, 0) \\).\n\nThe expected profit function is:\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = 55 \\times E[\\min(O, D)] + 55 \\times O - 20 \\times O - 10 \\times E[(O - D)^+]. \\]\n\nGiven that the demand \\( D \\) is normally distributed with mean 4000 and standard deviation 1600, we need to find the optimal \\( O \\) that maximizes the expected profit. This is typically done using numerical methods or simulation, but for simplicity, we can use the newsv approach or other optimization techniques.\n\nFor this problem, let's use the new service level approach. The critical ratio method is often used to find the optimal order quantity. The critical ratio \\( z \\) is given by:\n\\[ z = \\frac{55 - 20}{55 - 20} = \\frac{36}{35} = 1.0286. \\]\n\nHowever, since the critical ratio must be between 0 and 1, we need to find the closest value. In practice, we would use a more sophisticated method or simulation to find the exact optimal \\( O \\). For this problem, we can use the given information and assume the optimal \\( O \\) is around the mean demand, which is 4000 units.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected profit for \\( O = 4000 \\):\n1.

Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{O - 4000}{1600} = 0.458 \\implies O = 4000 + 0.458 \\times 1600 = 4732.8\n   \\]\n   Since \\( O \\) must be an integer, we round to the nearest whole number:\n   \\[\n   O = 4733\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the expected profit for \\( O = 4733 \\):**\n   The expected profit \\( E[P] \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   E[P] = 16 \\times 4733 + 19 \\times (4000 \\times 0.3086 + 4733 \\times 0.6914) - 10 \\times (4733 - 4000) \\times 0.6914\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\Phi^{-1}(0.3086) \\approx -0.5 \\) and \\( \\Phi^{-1}(0.6914) \\approx 0.5 \\). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   E[P] = 16 \\times 4733 + 19 \\times (4000 \\times 0.3086 + 4733 \\times 0.6914) - 10 \\times 733 \\times 0.6914\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   E[P] = 75728 + 19 \\times (1234.4 + 32800.62) - 5000.62\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E[P] = 75728 + 19 \\times 34035.02 - 5000.62\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E[P] = 75728 + 646665.38 - 5000.62\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E[P] = 717392.76\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected profit for the retailer under its optimal order size \\( O = 4733 \\) is \\(\\boxed{717392.76}\\).",
            "To determine the expected profit for the retailer under its optimal order size \\( O \\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the profit function:**\n   The profit \\( P \\) for the retailer depends on the demand \\( D \\) and the optimal order size \\( O \\). The profit function can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   P = \\begin{cases} \n   (36 - 20)O & \\text{if } D \\leq O \\\\\n   (36 - 20)O + (25 - 20)(O - D) - (10 \\times \\text{number of units left}) & \\text{if } D > O \n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the profit function, we get:\n   \\[\n   P = \\begin{cases} \n   16O & \\text{if } D \\leq O \\\\\n   16O + 5(O - D) - 10(O - D) = 16O + 5O - 5D - 10O + 10D = 11O + 5D & \\text{if } D > O \n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the optimal order size \\( O \\):**\n   The optimal order size \\( O \\) is the one that maximizes the expected profit. This involves finding the value of \\( O \\) that balances the cost of overage and cost of multinage. The critical ratio approach is often used for this purpose. The critical ratio \\( C \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   C = \\frac{p - c}{p - v}\n   \\]\n   where \\( p \\) is the price to customers, \\( c \\) is the production cost, and \\( v \\) is the selling price. Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   C = \\frac{55 - 20}{55 - 25} = \\frac{35}{30} = \\frac{7}{6} \\approx 1.1667\n   \\]\n   However, since the critical ratio must be between 0 and 1, we need to adjust our approach. Instead, we use the standard normal distribution to find the optimal order size.\n\n3. **Calculate the optimal order size \\( O \\):**\n   The optimal order size \\( O \\) is the smallest value such that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution at \\( O \\) is at least the critical ratio. The critical ratio is the probability that the demand is less than or equal to the order size. Since the critical ratio is greater than 1, we need to find the smallest \\( O \\) such that the CDF is at least 1. This is equivalent to finding the smallest \\( O \\) such that the CDF is at least 1.\n\n   The optimal order size \\( O \\) can be found using the inverse CDF of the normal distribution. The inverse CDF of a normal distribution with mean 4000 and standard deviation 1600 at 1 is:\n   \\[\n   O = 4000 + 1600 \\times 1.64485 = 4000 + 2631.76 = 6631.76 \\approx 6632\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the expected profit:**\n   The expected profit is the sum of the expected profit from the overage and the expected profit from the multinage. The expected profit from the overage is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit from overage} = 16 \\times 6632 = 106,112\n   \\]\n   The expected profit from the multinage is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit from multinage} = 5 \\times (4000 - 6632) \\times 0.15 = 5 \\times (-2632) \\times 0.15 = -19,740\n   \\]\n   The expected profit from the multinage is negative, so we need to adjust our approach. Instead, we use the expected value of the demand and the expected value of the profit.\n\n   The expected profit is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit} = 16 \\times 4000 = 64,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected profit for the retailer under its optimal order size \\( O \\) is \\boxed{64000}.",

The critical ratio \\( critical \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   critical = \\frac{P_c - C}{P_c - C_s} = \\frac{55 - 20}{55 - 10} = \\frac{35}{45} = \\frac{7}{9} \\approx 0.7778\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the corresponding z-score:**\n   Using the standard normal distribution table, find the z-score \\( z \\) such that \\( \\Phi(z) = 0.7778 \\).

The cost of overage is the difference between the production cost and thewholesale price, which is \\( \\$20 - \\$36 = -\\$16 \\) per unit (i.e., a loss of \\$16 per unit). The cost of shortage is the difference between the selling price and the wholesale price, which is \\( \\$55 - \\$36 = \\$19 \\) per unit.\n\nThe optimal order size \\( O \\) can be found using the critical ratio formula:\n\\[ F^{-1}(p_c / (p_c + c)) \\]\nwhere \\( p_c \\) is the profit per unit and \\( c \\) is the overage cost per unit.

The expected value of the excess units can be calculated using the normal distribution properties. The expected overage is given by:\n   \\[\n   E(\\text{overage}) = \\sigma \\cdot f(z) + (z \\sigma - \\mu) \\cdot (1 - F(z))\n   \\]\n   where \\(f(z)\\) is the probability density function at \\(z\\) and \\(F(z)\\) is the cumulative distribution function at \\(z\\). For \\(z = 2.88\\), \\(f(z) \\approx 0.0046\\) and \\(F(z) \\approx 0.9980\\). So,\n   \\[\n   E(\\text{overage}) = 1600 \\cdot 0.0046 + (2.88 \\cdot 1600 - 4000) \\cdot (1 - 0.9980) = 7.36 + (4608 - 4000) \\cdot 0.002 = 7.36 + 608 \\cdot 0.002 = 7.36 + 1.216 = 8.576\n   \\]\n   Rounding to the nearest whole number, the expected overage is approximately 8.58.\n\nTherefore, the expected overage at the retailer under its optimal order size \\(O\\) is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
            "To determine the expected overstock at the retailer under the optimal order size \\(O\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - \\(O\\): optimal order size\n   - \\(D\\): demand, which is normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu = 4000\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 1600\\)\n   - \\(C_p = 20\\): production cost per unit\n   - \\(P_w = 36\\): wholesale price per unit\n   - \\(P_c = 55\\): customer price per unit\n   - \\(S = 25\\): leftover sale price per unit\n   - \\(S_p = 10\\):scrap value per unit\n\n2. **Determine the Critical Value:**\n   The critical value \\(Q^*\\) is the optimal order quantity that balances the expected profit. For a normally distributed demand, the critical value is given by:\n   \\[\n   Q^* = \\mu + z \\sigma\n   \\]\n   where \\(z\\) is the standard normal deviate corresponding to the service level. The service level is determined by the critical ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Critical Ratio} = \\frac{P_c - C_p}{P_c - C_p + S - S_p} = \\frac{55 - 20}{55 - 20 + 25 - 10} = \\frac{35}{70} = 0.5\n   \\]\n   The standard normal deviate \\(z\\) corresponding to a service level of 0.5 is 0. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   Q^* = 4000 + 0 \\cdot 1600 = 4000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Expected Overstock:**\n   The expected overstock is the expected value of the excess inventory, which is the expected value of the positive difference between the order size \\(O\\) and the demand \\(D\\). Since the optimal order size \\(O\\) is 4000, the expected overstock is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Overstock} = E[\\max(O - D, 0)] = E[\\max(4000 - D, 0)]\n   \\]\n   For a normally distributed demand with mean 4000 and standard deviation 1600, the expected value of \\(\\max(4000 - D, 0)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   E[\\max(4000 - D, 0)] = \\sigma \\phi\\left(\\frac{4000 - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) = 1600 \\phi(0) = 1600 \\cdot 0.3989 = 638.24\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\phi\\) is the standard normal density function.\n\nTherefore, the expected overstock at the retailer under its optimal order size \\(O\\) is \\(\\boxed{638.24}\\).",

This is typically found by setting the expected overage profit equal to the expected overage loss.
