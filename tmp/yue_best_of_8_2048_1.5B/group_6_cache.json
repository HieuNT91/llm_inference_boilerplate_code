The annual demand (D) is 10,000 bottles per month, which translates to \\(10,000 \\times 12 = 120,000\\) bottles per year. The cost per order (S) is $100. The annual holding cost rate (h) is 20%, or 0.20. The cost per bottle (C) is not explicitly given, but we can assume it is the price per bottle before any discounts. However, since the problem does not specify the discount schedule, we will assume the cost per bottle is $10 (a common assumption for such problems if not specified).\n\nThe annual holding cost per bottle is \\(h \\times C = 0.20 \\times 10 = 2\\) dollars per bottle per year.

Therefore:\n\\[ Q = \\mu + z \\sigma = 20,000 + 1.96 \\times 8,000 = 20,000 + 15,680 = 35,680 \\]\n\nSince the manufacturer offers a discount if at least 25,000 ornaments are ordered, we need to check if ordering 25,000 or fewer would be more profitably. However, since the critical ratio is very close to 1, ordering 35,680 is more likely to meet the demand, but we need to ensure it's within the feasible range given the discount offer.\n\nGiven the discount offer and the high critical ratio, ordering 25,000 or fewer would likely result in lower expected profit due to the high cost of unsoldapproximate values. Therefore, the optimal order quantity is:\n\\[ \\boxed{35680} \\]",
            "To determine how many ornaments the designer should order, we need to consider the costs and revenues associated with different levels of demand. We'll use the concept of expected profit and compare the expected profit for ordering 25,000 ornaments with the expected profit for ordering a different quantity.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables and costs:\n- Cost per ornament: \\$30\n- Selling price per ornament: \\$95\n- Discounted price per ornament (if ordering 25,000 or more): \\$28\n- Probability of demand being exactly 25,000 or more: We need to use the standard normal distribution for this.\n\nThe profit function can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = (\\text{Number of ornaments ordered} \\times \\text{Selling price}) - (\\text{Number of ornaments ordered} \\times \\text{Cost price}) - \\text{Cost of unsold ornaments} \\]\n\nLet's denote the number of ornaments ordered as \\( Q \\). The profit function can be broken down into different cases based on the demand \\( D \\).\n\n### Case 1: \\( D < 25000 \\)\nIf the demand is less than 25,000, the designer will order 25,000 ornaments. The profit is:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = (25000 \\times 95) - (25000 \\times 30) = 25000 \\times 65 = 1625000 \\]\n\n### Case 2: \\( D \\geq 25000 \\)\nIf the demand is 25,000 or more, the designer will order \\( Q \\) ornaments. The profit is:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = (Q \\times 28) - (Q \\times 30) - (Q \\times (D - Q)) \\times 30 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = Q \\times 28 - Q \\times 30 - Q \\times (D - Q) \\times 30 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = Q \\times 28 - Q \\times 30 - Q \\times D + Q^2 \\times 30 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = Q \\times 28 - Q \\times 30 - Q \\times D + Q^2 \\times 30 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = Q \\times (28 - 30 - D + Q \\times 30) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = Q \\times (Q \\times 30 - D - 2) \\]\n\nTo find the optimal \\( Q \\), we need to compare the expected profit for ordering 25,000 with the expected profit for ordering a different quantity. However, since the exact probability distribution is normal, we can use the critical value from the standard normal distribution to find the optimal \\( Q \\).\n\nThe critical value for the normal distribution with mean 20,000 and standard deviation 8,000 to have a 50% chance of meeting the demand is the mean, which is 20,000. Therefore, the designer should order 25,000 ornaments to maximize the expected profit.\n\nThus, the designer should order \\(\\boxed{25000}\\) ornaments.",
            "To determine how many ornaments the designer should order, we need to consider the costs and revenues associated with different levels of demand. Specifically, we need to calculate the expected profit for different order quantities and choose the one that maximizes profit.\n\nLet's define the variables and the cost structure:\n- The cost of each ornament is \\$30.\n- The selling price of each ornament is \\$95 if all units are sold, but \\$28 if the price is discounted.\n- The demand is normally distributed with a mean of 20,000 and a standard deviation of 8,000.\n- If the designer orders more than 25,000 ornaments, the price is \\$28 per ornament.\n\nThe profit function can be defined as:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost} \\]\nwhere Revenue is the revenue from selling the ornaments and Cost is the cost of ordering the ornaments.\n\nIf the designer orders \\( Q \\) ornaments, the expected profit can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Expected Profit} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} \\left( 95 \\cdot x \\cdot f(x) - 30 \\cdot Q \\right) dx + \\int_{Q}^{\\infty} \\left( 28 \\cdot Q \\cdot f(x) - 30 \\cdot Q \\right) dx \\]\nwhere \\( f(x) \\) is the probability density function of the normal distribution.\n\nHowever, a simpler approach is to use the critical value method. We need to find the order quantity \\( Q \\) such that the probability of demand being less than or equal to \\( Q \\) is high enough to ensure a high expected profit.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected profit for ordering 25,000 ornaments:\n1. If the demand is less than or equal to 25,000, the designer will sell all 25,000 ornaments at \\$95 each and will lose the 25,000 - demand ornaments at \\$28 each.\n2.

            "To determine the expected profit for the retailer under the quantity flexibility contract, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the quantity flexibility contract**: The quantity flexibility contract with \\(\\alpha = \\beta = 0.2\\) means that the retailer can buy up to 1,000 units at the full price of \\$10 per unit, but if the demand exceeds 1,000 units, the retailer can buy the remaining units at a discounted price. The discount price is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount price} = \\text{Selling price} - \\alpha \\times (\\text{Selling price} - \\text{Production cost})\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount price} = 10 - 0.2 \\times (10 - 6) = 10 - 0.2 \\times 4 = 10 - 0.8 = 9.2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the expected demand**: The demand for DVDs is normally distributed with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 300. The retailer orders 1,000 units, so we need to calculate the expected profit based on the demand.\n\n3. **Calculate the expected profit**:\n   - If the demand is less than or equal to 1,000 units, the retailer sells all 1,000 units at the full price of \\$10 each.\n   - If the demand is more than 1,000 units, the retailer sells 1,000 units at \\$10 each and the remaining units at the discounted price of \\$9.2 each.\n\n   Let \\(D\\) be the demand, which is a normally distributed random variable with mean \\(\\mu = 1000\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 300\\). The expected profit \\(E[\\text{Profit}]\\) can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Profit}] = 1000 \\times 10 + E[(D - 1000)^+ \\times 9.2]\n   \\]\n   where \\((D - 1000)^+\\) is the positive part of \\(D - 1000\\), i.e., it is \\(D - 1000\\) if \\(D > 1000\\) and 0 otherwise.\n\n   The expected value of \\((D - 1000)^+\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   E[(D - 1000)^+ = E[D - 1000 \\mid D > 1000] \\times P(D > 1000)\n   \\]\n   Since \\(D\\) is normally distributed with mean 1000, \\(P(D > 1000) = 0.5\\). The conditional expectation \\(E[D - 1000 \\mid D > 1000]\\) is the mean of the truncated normal distribution from 1000 to \\(\\infty\\), which is:\n   \\[\n   E[D - 1000 \\mid D > 1000] = \\mu + \\sigma \\frac{\\phi(0)}{P(D > 1000)} = 1000 + 300 \\frac{\\phi(0)}{0.5}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\phi(0)\\) is the standard normal density at 0, which is \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\approx 0.3989\\).

            "To determine the expected profit for the retailer under the quantity flexibility contract, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Quantity flexibility contract**: The quantity flexibility contract with \\(\\alpha = 0.2\\) means that the retailer can buy up to 20% more than the ordered quantity. Since the retailer orders 1,000 units, the maximum quantity the retailer can buy is \\(1000 + 0.2 \\times 1000 = 1200\\) units.\n\n2. **Determine the expected demand**: The retailer's demand for DVDs is normally distributed with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 300.

This point is given by the mean of the normal distribution, \\( \\mu = 10 \\) million units, because the expected cost of the spot market will be minimized when the manufacturer signs up for the amount that matches the mean of the distribution.\n\nThus, the manufacturer should sign a long-term bulk contract for \\( Q = 10 \\) million units.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",
