Since the lead time demand is 400 printers and the mean demand over the lead time period is also 400 printers (because the lead time demand is exactly the amount ordered), the safety inventory is:\n\n\\[ \\text{ safety inventory} = \\text{lead time demand} - \\text{mean demand over lead time period} = 400 - 400 = 0 \\]\n\nTherefore, the safety inventory is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",

Therefore, the total demand during the lead time is also normally distributed with a mean of \\(2 \\times 2500 = 5000\\) and a standard deviation of \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times 500 \\approx 707.11\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the expected back orders:**\n   When there are 6,000 phones in inventory, the expected back orders are the expected demand during the lead time minus the inventory level. The expected demand during the lead time is 5000, and the inventory level is 6000. Since the inventory level is less than the expected demand, we expect back orders. The expected back orders are:\n   \\[\n   5000 - 6000 = -1000\n   \\]\n   However, since we cannot have negative back orders, we interpret this as the policy being short of meeting the demand by 1000 units. The expected back orders are thus 1000.\n\n3. **Calculate the expected holding cost:**\n   The holding cost is based on the expected ending inventory. The expected ending inventory is the initial inventory plus the expected demand during the lead time minus the back orders. Since we have 6000 phones in inventory and the expected demand is 5000, the expected ending inventory is:\n   \\[\n   6000 - 1000 = 5000\n   \\]\n   The holding cost is typically a cost per unit per unit time. Assuming a holding cost of $10 per unit per week (this is a common assumption but not given in the problem, so we'll use this as an example), the expected holding cost is:\n   \\[\n   5000 \\times 10 = 50000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total expected cost:**\n   The total expected cost is the sum of the expected back orders cost and the expected holding cost. The expected back orders cost is the expected back orders multiplied by the cost per unit (which is not given, so we'll assume it's $10 per unit for this example):\n   \\[\n   1000 \\times 10 = 10000\n   \\]\n   Adding the holding cost, the total expected cost is:\n   \\[\n   10000 + 50000 = 60000\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the RHS:**\n   The RHS is the total expected cost divided by the total demand during the lead time. The total demand during the lead time is 5000, so the RHS is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60000}{5000} = 12\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the right-hand side resulting from the policy is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."

This is equivalent to finding the probability that a normally distributed random variable with mean 500 and standard deviation 212.13 is less than or equal to 400.\n\nWe standardize this value using the z-score formula:\n\\[ z = \\frac{400 - 500}{212.13} \\approx -0.94 \\]\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score being less than or equal to -0.94 is approximately 0.1736. This means that there is a 17.36% chance that the demand over the lead time will exceed the amount of inventory ordered, which results in a stockout and a lost sales event.\n\nThe service level is the complement of this probability, which is the probability that the demand will not exceed the inventory. Therefore, the service level is:\n\\[ 1 - 0.1736 = 0.8264 \\]\nor 82.64%.\n\nSo, the service level achieved by Sam's Club due to this policy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{82.64\\%} \\]",
            "To determine what additional service the Sam's Club store achieves as a result of its inventory policy, we need to analyze the system in terms of the probability of stockouts and the lead time.\n\n1. **Identify the lead time and demand parameters:**\n   - The lead time (time between placing an order and receiving it) is 2 weeks.\n   - The weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 250 and a standard deviation of 150.\n   - Therefore, the 2-week demand is also normally distributed with a mean of \\(250 \\times 2 = 500\\) and a standard deviation of \\(150 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 212.13\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the service level:**\n   - The store orders 1,000 printers when the inventory drops to 600 printers. This means that the inventory level drops from 1,000 to 600, which is a decrease of 400 printers.\n   - The demand during the lead time is normally distributed with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 212.13. We need to find the probability that the demand during the lead time is greater than 400 printers.\n   - We standardize the normal variable: \\(Z = \\frac{400 - 500}{212.13} \\approx -0.94\\).\n   - Using the standard normal distribution table, the probability that \\(Z > -0.94\\) is approximately 0.8264. This means that there is an 82.64% chance that the demand during the lead time will be less than or equal to 400 printers. Therefore, the service level is 82.64%.\n\n3. **Calculate the serviceable units:**\n   - The serviceable units are the number of printers that can be sold during the lead time without a stockout. This is the difference between the lead time demand and the safety stock.\n   - The safety stock is the amount of inventory kept to cover the lead time demand with a certain service level. For a service level of 82.64%, the corresponding Z-score is approximately 0.94.\n   - The safety stock is \\(0.94 \\times 212.13 \\approx 200\\) printers.\n   - Therefore, the serviceable units are \\(500 - 200 = 300\\) printers.\n\n4. **Calculate the serviceable units per week:**\n   - Since the lead time is 2 weeks, the serviceable units per week is \\(\\frac{300}{2} = 150\\) printers.\n\n5. **Calculate the serviceable units per month:**\n   - Assuming the store is open 4 weeks a month, the serviceable units per month is \\(150 \\times 4 = 600\\) printers.\n\n6. **Calculate the serviceable units per year:**\n   - Assuming the store is open 52 weeks a year, the serviceable units per year is \\(150 \\times 52 = 7800\\) printers.\n\n7. **Calculate the serviceable units per day:**\n   - Assuming the store is open 365 days a year, the serviceable units per day is \\(\\frac{7800}{365} \\approx 21.496\\).\n\n8. **Calculate the serviceable units per week:**\n   - Assuming the store is open 4 weeks a month, the serviceable units per week is \\(\\frac{7800}{52} = 150\\) printers.\n\n9. **Calculate the serviceable units per day:**\n   - Assuming the store is open 365 days a year, the serviceable units per day is \\(\\frac{7800}{365} \\approx 21.496\\).\n\n10. **Calculate the serviceable units per week:**\n    - Assuming the store is open 4 weeks a month, the serviceable units per week is \\(\\frac{7800}{52} = 150\\) printers.\n\nTherefore, the additional service achieved by the policy is \\(\\boxed{250}\\).",
            "To determine the service level achieved by Sam's Club in terms of the number of orders placed per year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the critical value for the inventory policy:**\n   The inventory policy is to order 1,000 printers when the inventory drops to 600 printers. This means the inventory level after the order is placed should be 600 + 1,000 = 1,600 printers.\n\n2. **Determine the lead time and the demand during the lead time:**\n   HP takes 2 weeks to fill an order. The weekly demand for printers is normally distributed with a mean of 250 and a standard deviation of 150. Therefore, the mean demand during the lead time (2 weeks) is:\n   \\[\n   \\mu_{\\text{lead time}} = 2 \\times 250 = 500\n   \\]\n   and the standard deviation of the demand during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{\\text{lead time}} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 150 \\approx 212.13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the service level:**\n   The service level is the probability that the demand during the lead time does not exceed the inventory position (1,600 - 600 = 1,000 printers). This is equivalent to the probability that the demand during the lead time is less than or equal to 1,000 - 600 = 400 printers. We need to standardize this value to use the standard normal distribution table:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{400 - 500}{212.13} \\approx -0.47\n   \\]\n   Using the standard normal distribution table, the probability corresponding to \\(Z = -0.47\\) is approximately 0.319. Therefore, the service level is 0.319 or 31.9%.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of orders per year:**\n   The annual demand for printers is:\n   \\[\n   250 \\times 52 = 13,000\n   \\]\n   The number of orders placed per year is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{13,000}{1,000} = 13\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of orders placed per year is \\(\\boxed{13}\\)."
