Each phone charger costs the supplier \u20ac3 to produce. The phone charger will be sold to Rodgers Electronics for \u20ac4. Rodgers Electronics, in turn, prices a phone charger at \u20ac20 and forecasts demand to be normally distributed, with a mean of 8,000 and a standard deviation of 2,500. Any unsold phone chargers are discounted to \u20ac2, and all sell at this price. Rodgers Electronics will share 40 percent of the revenue with the supplier, keeping 60 percent for itself. What is the profit that Rodgers Electronics expects to make under its optimal order size?\nassistant\n",

The expected revenue is the sum of the revenue from sold units and the revenue from unsold units, minus the cost of producing the units and the cost of keeping the unsold units.\n\nLet's go through the calculations step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the optimal order quantity \\( Q^* \\)\n\nFirst, we need to find the critical value \\( z \\) for the service level. We will assume a common service level, such as 95%, which is a common choice in practice.\n\nFor a service level of 95%, the critical value \\( z \\) is approximately 1.645 (from standard normal distribution tables).\n\nNow, calculate \\( Q^* \\):\n\\[\nQ^* = \\mu + z \\sigma = 8000 + 1.645 \\times 2500 = 8000 + 4112.5 = 12112.5\n\\]\nSince we cannot order a fraction of a phone charger, we round to the nearest whole number:\n\\[\nQ^* = 12113\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the expected profit\n\nThe expected profit for values company can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Expected revenue from selling phone chargers:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected revenue} = P \\times \\mathbb{E}[\\min(Q, D)]\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\mathbb{E}[\\min(Q, D)] \\) is the expected number of phone chargers sold.\n\n2. **Expected revenue from selling unsold phone chargers:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected revenue from unsold phone chargers} = D \\times \\mathbb{E}[\\max(Q - D, 0)]\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\mathbb{E}[\\max(Q - D, 0)] \\) is the expected number of phone chargers not sold.\n\n3. **Total expected revenue:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total expected revenue} = \\text{Expected revenue from sold phone chargers} + \\text{Expected revenue from unsold phone chargers}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Cost of producing the phone chargers:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = C \\times Q\n   \\]\n\n5. **Cost of keeping the unsold phone chargers:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of keeping unsold phone chargers} = 0.4 \\times \\text{Total expected revenue from unsold phone chargers}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Expected profit:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit} = \\text{Total expected revenue} - \\text{Total cost} - \\text{Cost of keeping unsold phone chargers}\n   \\]\n\nUsing these steps, we can calculate the expected profit. However, the exact calculation involves complex integrals or simulation methods, which are beyond the scope of this step-by-step solution.

The cost of overage is:\n\n\\[ C_o = 2.50 - 1.50 = 1.00 \\]\n\nThe cost of underage is:\n\n\\[ C_u = 8.75 - 2.50 = 6.25 \\]\n\nThe service level z-score \\( z \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{C_u - C_o}{C_u + C_o} = \\frac{6.25 - 1.00}{6.25 + 1.00} = \\frac{5.25}{7.25} \\approx 0.7143 \\]\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table, the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.7143 is approximately 0.57. However, since the service level is 0.7143, we need to use the inverse normal distribution to find the z-score directly. For a service level of 0.7143, the z-score is approximately 0.57.\n\nNow, we can calculate the optimal order quantity:\n\n\\[ Q^* = 2500 + 0.57 \\times 600 = 2500 + 342 = 2842 \\]\n\nThe optimal order quantity is 2842 packets. The expected understock quantity is the difference between the optimal order quantity and the expected demand:\n\n\\[ \\text{Expected understock quantity} = Q^* - \\mu = 2842 - 2500 = 342 \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected understock quantity is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{342} \\]"

However, for simplicity, we can use the fact that the optimal ordering size is approximately the mean demand plus a certain number of standard deviations. This number is determined by the critical ratio, which is the probability that demand will be less than or equal to the ordering size.\n\n   The critical ratio is the probability that demand will be less than or equal to the ordering size.

            "To determine how many DVDs PrintRUs expects to sell at a discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - Mean (\\(\\mu\\)) = 10,000 DVDs\n   - Standard Deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) = 5,000 DVDs\n   - Selling price to the general public (\\(P_{\\text{public}}\\)) = \\$19.99\n   - Discounted price (\\(P_{\\text{discount}}\\)) = \\$4.99\n   - Cost price to the studio (\\(C\\)) = \\$1 per DVD\n\n2. **Determine the break-even point:**\n   The break-even point is the number of DVDs at which the revenue from selling at the discounted price equals the revenue from selling at the general public price.\n\n   \\[\n   P_{\\text{public}} \\times x = P_{\\text{discount}} \\times (x - y)\n   \\]\n\n   where \\(x\\) is the number of DVDs ordered and \\(y\\) is the number of DVDs sold at the discounted price.\n\n3. **Solve for \\(y\\):**\n   Rearrange the equation to solve for \\(y\\):\n\n   \\[\n   19.99x = 4.99(x - y)\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   19.99x = 4.99x - 4.99y\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   19.99x - 4.99x = -4.99y\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   15x = 4.99y\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{15x}{4.99}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the optimal ordering size \\(x\\):**\n   The optimal ordering size \\(x\\) is the point where the expected profit is maximized. This occurs when the expected number of DVDs sold at the discounted price equals the expected number of DVDs sold at the general public price.\n\n   The expected number of DVDs sold at the discounted price is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution at the break-even point.\n\n   First, we need to find the break-even point in terms of the number of DVDs. Let \\(z\\) be the z-score corresponding to the break-even point:\n\n   \\[\n   P_{\\text{public}} \\times x = P_{\\text{discount}} \\times (x - z\\sigma)\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   19.99x = 4.99(x - z \\times 5000)\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   19.99x = 4.99x - 4.99z \\times 5000\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   19.99x - 4.99x = -4.99z \\times 5000\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   15x = 4.99z \\times 5000\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{15x}{4.99 \\times 5000}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{15x}{24950}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{3x}{4990}\n   \\]\n\n   Using the standard normal distribution table, we find the z-score corresponding to the desired service level. For simplicity, we assume a 95% service level, which corresponds to a z-score of approximately 1.645.\n\n   \\[\n   1.645 = \\frac{3x}{4990}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1.645 \\times 4990}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{8257.55}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   x \\approx 2752.52\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\(x\\) must be an integer, we round to the nearest whole number:\n\n   \\[\n   x \\approx 2753\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of DVDs sold at the discount:**\n   Using the optimal ordering size \\(x = 2753\\):\n\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{15 \\times 2753}{4.99}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{41295}{4.99}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   y \\approx 8282.65\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\(y\\) must be an integer, we round to the nearest whole number:\n\n   \\[\n   y \\approx 8283\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, PrintRUs expects to sell approximately \\(\\boxed{8283}\\) DVDs at a discount."

We denote this as \\( D_A \\sim N(3000, 1000^2) \\).\n\n2. **Determine the service level for segment A:**\n   Segment A wants to commit to a shipment with only 24 hours' notice, which means they will be satisfied if the demand is met within the next 24 hours. Assuming the service level is the probability that the demand will not exceed the reserved capacity, we need to find the capacity that corresponds to a certain service level. Since the problem does not specify a service level, we will assume a common service level of 95%, which is a common choice in such problems. This means we need to find the value \\( x \\) such that \\( P(D_A \\leq x) = 0.95 \\).\n\n3. **Find the z-score corresponding to the service level:**\n   The z-score for a 95% service level is approximately 1.645 (from the standard normal distribution table).\n\n4. **Calculate the reserved capacity for segment A:**\n   The reserved capacity \\( x \\) can be calculated using the formula for the normal distribution:\n   \\[\n   x = \\mu + z \\cdot \\sigma = 3000 + 1.645 \\cdot 1000 = 3000 + 1645 = 4645\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the amount of capacity that should be reserved for segment A is \\( 4645 \\) cubic feet.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4645}\n\\]"
