            "To determine how many engines should be loaded onto each truck, we need to consider the cost of transportation and the cost of holding inventory. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the daily demand and cost parameters:**\n   - Daily demand for motorcycles: 300\n   - Cost of each engine: \\$450\n   - transportation cost per truck: \\$1,500\n   - holding cost rate: 20% per year\n\n2. **Calculate the annual holding cost for one engine:**\n   - Since the holding cost rate is 20% per year, the annual holding cost for one engine is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Annual holding cost per engine} = 0.20 \\times 450 = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of engines needed per day:**\n   - Since each motorcycle plant assembles and sells 300 motorcycles each day, and assuming each motorcycle requires one engine, the plant needs 300 engines per day.\n\n4. **Calculate the annual demand for engines:**\n   - The annual demand for engines is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Annual demand} = 300 \\text{ engines/day} \\times 365 \\text{ days/year} = 109,500 \\text{ engines/year}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determine the number of engines to load onto each truck:**\n   - To minimize the total cost ( transportation cost + holding cost), we need to balance the transportation cost and the holding cost. The optimal number of engines to load onto each truck can be found by balancing the transportation cost and the holding cost.\n   - Let's denote the number of engines loaded onto each truck as \\( Q \\). The number of trips per year is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of trips per year} = \\frac{109,500}{Q}\n     \\]\n   - The total transportation cost per year is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total transportation cost} = 1500 \\times \\frac{109,500}{Q} = \\frac{1,642,500}{Q}\n     \\]\n   - The average inventory of engines is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average inventory} = \\frac{Q}{2}\n     \\]\n   - The total holding cost per year is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total holding cost} = 90 \\times \\frac{Q}{2} = 45Q\n     \\]\n   - The total cost per year is the sum of the transportation cost and the holding cost:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost} = \\frac{1,642,500}{Q} + 45Q\n     \\]\n   - To minimize the total cost, we take the derivative of the total cost with respect to \\( Q \\) and set it to zero:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d(\\text{Total cost})}{dQ} = -\\frac{1,642,500}{Q^2} + 45 = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     45Q^2 = 1,642,500\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     Q^2 = \\frac{1,642,500}{45} = 36,500\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     Q = \\sqrt{36,500} \\approx 191\n     \\]\n   - Since we can only load whole engines, we round 191 to the nearest whole number. However, to ensure the optimal solution, we should check the total cost for both 190 and 192 engines to ensure we have the minimum cost.\n\n6. **Verify the optimal number of engines:**\n   - For \\( Q = 190 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost} = \\frac{1,642,500}{190} + 45 \\times 190 = 8,644.74 + 8,550 = 17,194.74\n     \\]\n   - For \\( Q = 192 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost} = \\frac{1,642,500}{192} + 45 \\times 192 = 8,552.08 + 8,640 = 17,192.08\n     \\]\n   - Since the total cost is slightly lower for \\( Q = 192 \\), the optimal number of engines to load onto each truck is 192.\n\nTherefore, the number of engines that should be loaded onto each truck is \\(\\boxed{192}\\).",
            "To determine how many engines should be loaded onto each truck, we need to balance the cost of transporting engines with the cost of holding them in inventory. We will use the economic order quantity (EOQ) model to find the optimal number of engines to be loaded onto each truck.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- \\( D \\) = annual demand for engines = 300 motorcycles/day \\(\\times\\) 365 days/year = 109,500 engines/year\n- \\( C \\) = cost per engine = \\$450\n- \\( h \\) = holding cost per engine per year = 20% of \\$450 = \\$90\n- \\( Q \\) = order quantity (number of engines loaded onto each truck)\n- \\( n \\) = number of orders per year = \\(\\frac{D}{Q}\\)\n\nThe total cost \\( T \\) of placing orders and holding inventory is given by:\n\\[ T = \\left(\\frac{D}{Q} \\times C\\right) + \\left(\\frac{Q}{2} \\times h\\right) \\]\n\nTo minimize the total cost, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that minimizes \\( T \\).

Since the plant assembles 300 motorcycles each day and each truck trip is a round trip, the number of trips needed per day is \\( \\frac{300}{Q} \\). Therefore, the transportation cost per day is \\( 1500 \\times \\frac{Q}{300} = 5Q \\).\n   - The holding cost per day is the average number of engines in inventory multiplied by the holding cost per engine per day. The average number of engines in inventory is \\( \\frac{Q}{2} \\) (since the inventory level goes from \\( Q \\) to 0 and back to \\( Q \\) over the course of a day).

Since the plant assembles 300 motorcycles each day, a reasonable number of engines to load onto each truck would be 300.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The optimal number of engines to load onto each truck is \\( \\boxed{300} \\).",

Since the engines are used at a constant rate, the average inventory cost is the same as the holding cost calculated above.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total annual cost of engines} = 45Q\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total annual transportation cost:**\n   - The plant assembles 300 engines per day, so the number of trips per year is \\( \\frac{300 \\times 365}{Q} \\).\n   - The total annual transportation cost is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total annual transportation cost} = 1500 \\times \\frac{300 \\times 365}{Q} = \\frac{1500 \\times 300 \\times 365}{Q} = \\frac{163875000}{Q}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total annual cost:**\n   - The total annual cost is the sum of the total annual cost of engines and the total annual transportation cost:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total annual cost} = 45Q + \\frac{163875000}{Q}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Minimize the total annual cost:**\n   - To minimize the total annual cost, we take the derivative of the total annual cost with respect to \\( Q \\) and set it to zero:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d}{dQ} \\left( 45Q + \\frac{163875000}{Q} \\right) = 45 - \\frac{163875000}{Q^2} = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     45Q^2 = 163875000\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     Q^2 = \\frac{163875000}{45} = 3646111.11\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     Q = \\sqrt{3646111.11} \\approx 1909.12\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( Q \\) must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number. Therefore, \\( Q = 1909 \\).\n\n8. **Verify the solution:**\n   - We need to check if \\( Q = 1909 \\) is a reasonable solution by calculating the total annual cost for \\( Q = 1909 \\) and comparing it to the total annual cost for \\( Q = 1908 \\) and \\( Q = 1910 \\).\n   - For \\( Q = 1909 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total annual cost} = 45 \\times 1909 + \\frac{163875000}{1909} \\approx 85905 + 85839.56 = 171744.56\n     \\]\n   - For \\( Q = 1908 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total annual cost} = 45 \\times 1908 + \\frac{163875000}{1908} \\approx 85860 + 85889.56 = 171749.56\n     \\]\n   - For \\( Q = 1910 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total annual cost} = 45 \\times 1910 + \\frac{163875000}{1910} \\approx 85950 + 85839.56 = 171789.56\n     \\]\n   - The total annual cost is minimized at \\( Q = 1909 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of engines that should be loaded onto each truck is \\(\\boxed{1909}\\)."

            "To determine the cycle inventory of engines atarity, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the daily demand for engines:**\n   Since the motorcycle plant assembles and sells 300 motorcycles each day, and each motorcycle requires one engine, the daily demand for engines is also 300 engines.\n\n2. **Determine the annual demand for engines:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual demand} = \\text{Daily demand} \\times \\text{Number of days in a year}\n   \\]\n   Assuming a 365-day year:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual demand} = 300 \\times 365 = 109,500 \\text{ engines}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the holding cost per engine:**\n   The holding cost is 20 percent per year of the cost of each engine.\n   \\[\n   \\text{ hold cost per engine} = 0.20 \\times 450 = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the cost of placing an order:**\n   The cost of placing an order is the cost of transportation between the plants, which is \\$1,500.\n\n5. **Calculate the economic order quantity (EOQ):**\n   The EOQ formula is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{EOQ} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times \\text{Annual demand} \\times \\text{ ordering cost}}{\\text{ holding cost per unit}}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{EOQ} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 109,500 \\times 1500}{90}}\n   \\]\n   Simplify inside the square root:\n   \\[\n   \\text{EOQ} = \\sqrt{\\frac{328,500,000}{90}} = \\sqrt{3,649,444.44} \\approx 1910.75\n   \\]\n   Since we cannot order a fraction of an engine, we round to the nearest whole number:\n   \\[\n   \\text{EOQ} \\approx 1911 \\text{ engines}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the cycle time:**\n   The cycle time is the time between two consecutive orders.

However, since the problem does not provide information on the ordering cost, we will assume the cycle time is based on the daily demand and the cost per engine.\n\n6. **Calculate the cycle inventory:**\n   The cycle inventory is the average inventory held at the engine plant.

The cost of one engine is \\$450, so the holding cost per engine per year is:\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 450 = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total annual cost of holding engines:**\n   The total annual cost of holding engines is the holding cost per engine multiplied by the annual demand for engines:\n   \\[\n   109,500 \\text{ engines/year} \\times 90 \\text{ dollars/ engine} = 9,855,000 \\text{ dollars/year}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the optimal order quantity (E) using the economic order quantity (EOQ) formula:**\n   TheEOQ formula is:\n   \\[\n   E = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times D \\times C}{H}}\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( D \\) is the annual demand (109,500 engines),\n   - \\( C \\) is the cost per order (\\$1,500),\n   - \\( H \\) is the holding cost per engine per year (\\$90).\n\n   Plugging in the values, we get:\n   \\[\n   E = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 109,500 \\times 1,500}{90}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{328,500,000}{90}} = \\sqrt{3,649,444.44} \\approx 1,910.81 \\text{ engines}\n   \\]\n   Since we cannot order a fraction of an engine, we round to the nearest whole number, so \\( E \\approx 1,911 \\) engines.\n\n5. **Calculate the cycle inventory:**\n   The cycle inventory is half of the optimal order quantity because the inventory is restocked when it reaches zero:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cycle inventory} = \\frac{1,911}{2} = 955.5 \\approx 956 \\text{ engines}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cycle inventory of engines at across is \\(\\boxed{956}\\).",

            "To determine the frequency of orders and the bullwhip effect, we need to analyze the inventory levels and the lead time of the supplier. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the lead time and the demand pattern:**\n   - The lead time is 2 weeks.\n   - The weekly demand for shampoo is normally distributed with a mean of 2,800 and a standard deviation of 1,000.\n\n2. **Calculate the expected demand during the lead time:**\n   - The expected demand during the lead time is the mean demand per week multiplied by the lead time.\n   - Expected demand = 2,800 units/week * 2 weeks = 5,600 units.\n\n3. **Determine the safety stock:**\n   - The store orders 11,000 units when there are 8,500 units in inventory. This means the store is ordering enough to cover the expected demand during the lead time plus some extra to account for variability in demand.\n   - The safety stock is the difference between the order quantity and the expected demand during the lead time.\n   - safety stock = 11,000 units - 5,600 units = 5,400 units.\n\n4. **Calculate the service level:**\n   - The service level is the probability that the demand during the lead time will not exceed the safety stock. This is given by the ratio of the safety stock to the expected demand during the lead time.\n   - Service level = 5,400 units / 5,600 units \u2248 0.9643 or 96.43%.\n\n5. **Determine the frequency of orders:**\n   - The frequency of orders is the time between orders. Since the lead time is 2 weeks and the safety stock is 5,400 units, the store will place an order every 2 weeks.\n\n6. **Calculate the bullwhip effect:**\n   - The bullwhip effect is the ratio of the variance in the order quantity to the variance in the demand. However, since the problem does not provide the variance in the order quantity, we can infer that the bullwhip effect is minimal because the store orders a large quantity (11,000 units) to cover the lead time demand with a safety stock of 5,400 units.\n\nTherefore, the store achieves a relatively high service level of 96.43% and orders every 2 weeks. The bullwhip effect is minimal.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\boxed{2 \\text{ weeks}}",

It is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{\\text{ inventory level} - \\text{mean demand}}{\\text{standard deviation}} = \\frac{8500 - 2800}{1000} = \\frac{5700}{1000} = 5.7\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the probability corresponding to the z-score:**\n   Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find the probability that the z-score is less than 5.7. This probability is essentially 1 (or 100%) because 5.7 is a very high z-score, indicating that the inventory level is extremely high relative to the mean and standard deviation of the demand.\n\n4. **Interpret the service level:**\n   A z-score of 5.7 corresponds to a service level of approximately 100%. This means that the store is almost certain that the inventory level will not be exceeded by the demand, even when the supplier takes two weeks to arrive.\n\nTherefore, the store achieves a service level of \\boxed{100\\%}.",

This involves finding the optimal order quantity that minimizes the total cost.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( Q \\) as the order quantity.\n- \\( D \\) as the demand, which is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 20,000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 8,000 \\).\n- \\( c \\) as the cost per unit ordered, which is \\$30.\n- \\( p \\) as the selling price per unit, which is \\$95.\n- \\( h \\) as the holding cost per unit unsold, which is \\$0 (since all unsold ornaments are destroyed).\n\nThe expected profit \\( E[\\text{Profit}] \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = p \\cdot E[\\min(Q, D)] - c \\cdot Q \\]\n\nThe expected value \\( E[\\min(Q, D)] \\) can be calculated using the properties of the normal distribution.

            "To determine the cost of understocking, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The replenishment lead time is 3 weeks, and the weekly demand is 200 bananas.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total demand during lead time} = 200 \\text{ bananas/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the optimal order quantity:**\n   The Banana Stand orders 1000 bananas when the inventory drops to 600 bananas. This means the optimal order quantity is 1000 bananas.\n\n3. **Calculate the carrying cost:**\n   The carrying cost is 40% of the cost of the bananas. Each banana costs \\$0.50.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one banana} = \\$0.50\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Carrying cost per banana} = 0.40 \\times \\$0.50 = \\$0.20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the carrying cost for the optimal order quantity:**\n   The optimal order quantity is 1000 bananas.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Carrying cost for 1000 bananas} = 1000 \\text{ bananas} \\times \\$0.20/\\text{banana} = \\$200\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the cost of understocking:**\n   The cost of understocking is the cost of the bananas that are held in inventory when the stand is out of stock. Since the optimal order quantity is 1000 bananas and the stand is out of stock when the inventory drops to 600 bananas, the stand is holding 400 bananas when it is out of stock.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of understocking per banana} = \\$0.50\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of understocking for 400 bananas} = 400 \\text{ bananas} \\times \\$0.50/\\text{banana} = \\$200\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of understocking is \\(\\boxed{200}\\).",
            "To determine the cost of understocking, we need to calculate the expected holding cost and the expected backorder cost. However, the problem only asks for the cost of understocking, which is the cost associated with the back orders that occur when the inventory falls short of the expected demand.\n\nFirst, let's identify the key parameters:\n- Weekly demand: 200 bananas\n- Standard deviation of weekly demand: 50 bananas\n- Re order point: 600 bananas\n- lead time: 3 weeks\n- Cost per banana: \\$0.50\n- holding cost: 40% of the cost of the banana\n\nThe manager orders 1000 bananas when the inventory drops to 600 bananas. This means that the inventory will be back ordered when it falls to 600 bananas. The expected holding cost is not directly relevant to the cost of understocking, but the expected backorder cost is.\n\nThe expected backorder cost is the cost of the bananas that are back ordered. Since the manager orders 1000 bananas when the inventory drops to 600 bananas, the expected backorder cost per week is the cost of the bananas that are back ordered.\n\nThe expected backorder cost per week can be calculated as follows:\n1. Determine the expected number of bananas back ordered per week. Since the manager orders 1000 bananas when the inventory drops to 600 bananas, the expected number of bananas back ordered per week is the expected weekly demand minus the expected inventory level just before the order is placed.\n2. The expected inventory level just before the order is placed is 600 bananas. The expected weekly demand is 200 bananas. Therefore, the expected number of bananas back ordered per week is 200 bananas.\n3. The cost per banana is \\$0.50. Therefore, the expected backorder cost per week is:\n   \\[\n   200 \\text{ bananas} \\times \\$0.50/\\text{banana} = \\$100\n   \\]\n\nThus, the cost of understocking is \\(\\boxed{100}\\)."

Since the lead time demand is 5600 units and the inventory after the lead time is 3100 units, the inventory will be sufficient if the demand during the lead time is less than or equal to 3100 units.\n\nWe need to find the probability that the demand is less than or equal to 3100 units.
