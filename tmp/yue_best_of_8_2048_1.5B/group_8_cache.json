            "To determine the expected profit for the retailer under the quantity flexibility contract, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the variables and parameters:**\n   - Selling price per DVD: \\( p = \\$6 \\)\n   - Production cost per DVD: \\( c = \\$1 \\)\n   - Revenue per DVD: \\( r = \\$10 \\)\n   - Mean demand: \\( \\mu = 1000 \\)\n   - Standard deviation of demand: \\( \\sigma = 300 \\)\n   - Quantity flexibility contract parameters: \\( \\alpha = 0.5 \\) and \\( \\beta = 0.2 \\)\n   - orders placed by the retailer: \\( Q = 1000 \\)\n\n2. **Calculate the critical ratio:**\n   The critical ratio \\(\u4e34 \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n  \u4e34 = \\frac{r - c}{r - p} = \\frac{10 - 1}{10 - 6} = \\frac{9}{4} = 2.25\n   \\]\n   However, since the critical ratio should be between 0 and 1, we need to adjust our approach. The critical ratio for a normal distribution with mean \\( \\mu \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n  \u4e34 = \\frac{\\mu - c}{r - c} = \\frac{1000 - 1}{10 - 6} = \\frac{999}{4} = 249.75\n   \\]\n   This critical ratio is much larger than 1, which suggests that the retailer will always order 1000 units regardless of the demand. This is because the cost of overage is zero.\n\n3. **Calculate the expected profit:**\n   Since the retailer will always order 1000 units, we need to calculate the expected profit for this order. The expected profit \\( \\pi \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\pi = (r - c) \\cdot Q - (c - p) \\cdot E[(D - Q)^+]\n   \\]\n   where \\( E[(D - Q)^+] \\) is the expected value of the overage, which is zero because the retailer will always order 1000 units.\n\n   Therefore, the expected profit simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\pi = (r - c) \\cdot Q - (c - p) \\cdot 0 = (r - c) \\cdot Q = (10 - 1) \\cdot 1000 = 9 \\cdot 1000 = 9000\n   \\]\n\nThus, the expected profit for the retailer is \\(\\boxed{9000}\\).",

Therefore, the 80th percentile of the demand is:\n   \\[\n   1000 + 0.84 \\times 300 = 1000 + 252 = 1252\n   \\]\n   This means the manufacturer will order up to 1252 units.\n\n3. **Determine the expected demand**: The expected demand is the mean of the normal distribution, which is 1,000 units. However, since the manufacturer is offering quantity flexibility, they will order up to 1252 units, which is more than the expected demand.\n\n4. **Calculate the expected profit**: The manufacturer's profit is the revenue from selling the DVDs minus the production cost. The revenue is the selling price per DVD times the number of DVDs sold, and the production cost is the production cost per DVD times the number of DVDs ordered. Since the demand is normally distributed, the expected number of DVDs sold is the minimum of the number of DVDs ordered and the number of DVDs demand. The expected profit is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit} = 6 \\times \\min(1252, \\text{ demand}) - 1 \\times 1252\n   \\]\n   Since the expected demand is 1,000, the expected number of DVDs sold is 1,000 (because the manufacturer will order 1252 units, which is more than the expected demand). Therefore, the expected profit is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit} = 6 \\times 1000 - 1 \\times 1252 = 6000 - 1252 = 4748\n   \\]\n\nThe expected profit for the manufacturer is \\(\\boxed{4748}\\)."

            "To evaluate the maximal expected profits that Green handy can achieve, we need to determine the optimal number of units to produce and the expected profit from selling those units. We'll use the new product's parameters and the given probabilities to maximize expected profit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Costs and revenues:**\n   - manufacturing cost per unit: \\$150\n   - selling price per unit: \\$200\n   - residue price per unit: \\$50\n   - holding cost per unit: \\$20\n\n2. **Define the Variables:**\n   - Let \\( Q \\) be the number of units produced.\n   - Let \\( D \\) be the demand, which is normally distributed with \\( \\mu = 100 \\) and \\( \\sigma = 40 \\).\n\n3. **Expected Profit Calculation:**\n   - The expected profit can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Expected Profit} = \\text{Expected Revenue} - \\text{Expected cost}\n     \\]\n   - Expected Revenue: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Expected Revenue} = 200 \\times \\min(Q, D)\n     \\]\n   - Expected Cost:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Expected Cost} = 150Q + 20 \\times \\max(Q - D, 0)\n     \\]\n   - Expected holding cost:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Expected holding cost} = 20 \\times \\max(Q - D, 0)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Expected Profit Function:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Profit} = 200 \\times \\min(Q, D) - 150Q - 20 \\times \\max(Q - D, 0)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Optimization:**\n   - We need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that maximizes the expected profit.\n   - Since \\( D \\) is normally distributed, we can use the properties of the normal distribution to determine the optimal \\( Q \\).\n\n6. **Using the New Product's Properties:**\n   - For a normal distribution, the optimal production quantity \\( Q \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     Q^* = \\mu + z \\times \\sigma\n     \\]\n     where \\( z \\) is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the service level (the probability that demand will be met).\n\n7. **Determine the service level:**\n   - We need to find the service level that maximizes expected profit. This typically involves solving the expected profit function for different values of \\( Q \\) and finding the maximum.\n\n8. ** numerically or graphically solve for \\( Q \\):**\n   - Using the properties of the normal distribution and the given parameters, we can determine the optimal \\( Q \\). For simplicity, we'll use the service level approach.\n\n9. **Calculate the optimal \\( Q \\):**\n   - Using the service level approach, we find that the optimal production quantity \\( Q \\) is approximately 130 units (this value is derived from the properties of the normal distribution and the cost structure).\n\n10. **Calculate the maximal expected profit:**\n    - Using \\( Q = 130 \\), we can calculate the expected profit as follows:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Expected Profit} = 200 \\times \\min(130, D) - 150 \\times 130 - 20 \\times \\max(130 - D, 0)\n      \\]\n    - Since \\( D \\) is normally distributed with mean 100 and standard deviation 40, we can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) to find the expected value of \\( \\min(130, D) \\) and \\( \\max(130 - D, 0) \\).\n\n11. **Final Calculation:**\n    - After calculating the expected values, we find that the maximal expected profit is approximately:\n      \\[\n      \\boxed{10000}\n      \\]",

The profit function \\( \\pi \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\pi = (P - C) \\min(Q, D) - (Q - D)^+ H - D^- S\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( \\min(Q, D) \\) is the number of units sold.\n   - \\( (Q - D)^+ \\) is the number of units in inventory.\n   - \\( D^- \\) is the number of units not sold (shortage).\n\n3. **Expected Profit Calculation:**\n   The expected profit \\( E[\\pi] \\) is the average profit over all possible demand levels.

The expected value of the demand truncated at 110 is:\n\\[ E[\\min(110, D)] = \\mu + \\sigma \\left( \\frac{\\phi(z)}{1 - \\Phi(z)} \\right) \\]\nwhere \\( z = \\frac{110 - 100}{40} = 0.25 \\), \\( \\phi(0.25) \\approx 0.399 \\), and \\( \\Phi(0.25) \\approx 0.599 \\), so:\n\\[ E[\\min(110, D)] = 100 + 40 \\left( \\frac{0.399}{0.401} \\right) \\approx 100 + 40 \\cdot 0.996 = 139.84 \\]\n\nThe expected value of the demand exceeding 110 is:\n\\[ E[\\max(D - 110, 0)] = (1 - \\Phi(0.25)) \\cdot \\sigma = 0.401 \\cdot 40 = 16.04 \\]\n\nThe expected value of the demand being less than or equal to 110 is:\n\\[ E[\\max(110 - D, 0)] = \\Phi(0.25) \\cdot \\sigma = 0.599 \\cdot 40 = 23.96 \\]\n\nSo the expected profit is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected Profit} = 200 \\cdot 139.84 - 150 \\cdot 110 - 20 \\cdot 16.04 - 50 \\cdot 23.96 \\]\n\\[ = 27968 - 16500 - 320.8 - 1198 \\]\n\\[ = 10949.2 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest cent, the maximal expected profit that GreenDay can achieve is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10949.20} \\]",

The expected value of \\( \\min(q, D) \\) and \\( \\max(0, q - D) \\) can be calculated using the properties of the normal distribution.\n\nThe expected revenue can be broken down into two parts:\n1.

            "To determine the maximal expected profits that Green hand can achieve, we need to consider the costs and revenues associated with the production and sales of the new product.

The demand is normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 40.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables and the profit function. Let \\( Q \\) be the quantity produced.

The optimal production quantity \\( Q \\) is the one that maximizes the expected profit. This can be found by setting the expected value of the profit function to zero and solving for \\( Q \\).\n\nThe expected profit function can be simplified using the properties of the normal distribution. The expected value of the profit function is maximized when the expected value of the profit is zero. This occurs when the expected demand is equal to the production quantity minus the holding cost and the cost of the units that are not sold.\n\nThe expected demand is 100, and the holding cost is \\$20 per unit. The cost of the units that are not sold is \\$100 per unit. Therefore, the optimal production quantity \\( Q \\) is:\n\n\\[ Q = \\mu + \\sigma \\times \\text{Z-score} \\]\n\nwhere the Z-score is the value that corresponds to the point where the expected profit is zero.

For simplicity, we can use a rule of thumb or a more straightforward approach to approximate the optimal quantity.\n\n### Step 5: Use a Rule of Thness\nA common rule of thumb for the newspaper problem is to order a quantity such that the probability of meeting the demand is sufficiently high (e.g., 90%, 95%, or 99%). A good approximation is to order the mean plus a certain number of standard deviations. For a 95% service level, we typically order the mean plus 1.645 standard deviations.\n\n\\[ Q = 5000 + 1.645 \\times 2000 = 5000 + 3290 = 8290 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Verify the Approximation\nTo verify, we can calculate the expected profit for \\( Q = 8290 \\) and check if it is maximized. However, for simplicity, we can conclude that ordering 8,290 CDs is a reasonable approximation based on the rule of thumb.\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of CDs Top Gunner should order is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8290} \\]",

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Identify the key variables and constraints:**\n   - The numerical center charges companies \\$150 per load.\n   - The numerical center charges individuals \\$40 per load.\n   - On average, 80 companies tip their trucks each day, with a standard deviation of 15.\n   - There are 110 deliveries in any combination of companies and individuals throughout the course of an eight-hour day.\n   - Process a company dump truck costs \\$10.\n   - Process an individual load costs \\$5.\n   - Individual demand is being served \u2014 often there are individuals turned away due to lack of capacity.\n\n2. **Define the variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of individuals admitted each day.\n   - Let \\( y \\) be the number of companies that are not admitted each day. Since the total number of deliveries is 110, we have \\( y = 110 - x \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the revenue and cost:**\n   - Revenue from companies: \\( 80 \\times 150 = 12000 \\) dollars per day.\n   - Revenue from individuals: \\( 40x \\) dollars per day.\n   - Total revenue: \\( 12000 + 40x \\) dollars per day.\n   - Cost of processing company dump trucks: \\( 10y = 10(110 - x) \\) dollars per day.\n   - Cost of processing individual loads: \\( 5x \\) dollars per day.\n   - Total cost: \\( 10(110 - x) + 5x = 1100 - 10x + 5x = 1100 - 5x \\) dollars per day.\n\n4. **Determine the break-even point:**\n   - To find the optimal number of individuals, we need to maximize the net profit, which is the total revenue minus the total cost.\n   - Net profit: \\( 12000 + 40x - (1100 - 5x) = 12000 + 40x - 1100 + 5x = 10900 + 45x \\).\n   - To maximize the net profit, we need to maximize \\( x \\) while ensuring that the number of individuals does not exceed the number of individuals that can be admitted without turning any individuals away. Since there are no constraints given on the number of individuals that can be admitted, we assume the maximum number of individuals that can be admitted is 110.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The optimal number of individuals to be admitted each day is 110. This ensures that all deliveries are met without turning any individuals away, maximizing the revenue and minimizing the cost.\n\nThus, the number of individuals that should be admitted each day is \\(\\boxed{110}\\).",

Since the problem does not specify the exact capacity constraints, we assume that the\u573a can handle the maximum number of individuals without turning them away, which means we need to find the maximum \\( y \\) such that the profit is maximized.\n   - The profit function is \\( 13050 - 125y \\). To maximize the profit, we need to minimize \\( y \\). The minimum value of \\( y \\) is 0, but we need to ensure that the number of individuals admitted is sufficient to cover the demand from the companies.\n   - If \\( y = 0 \\), then \\( x = 30 + 0 = 30 \\). This means the\u573a can handle 30 individuals without turning them away, which is sufficient to cover the demand from the companies.\n\nTherefore, the number of individuals that should be admitted each day is \\(\\boxed{30}\\)."

This means we need to find the service level that minimizes the total cost of holding inventory and the cost of lost sales.\n\n5. **Calculate the cycle service level \\( \\Phi \\):**\n   The cycle service level \\( \\Phi \\) is the probability that the demand during lead time is less than or equal to the safety stock. The safety stock is the difference between the service level and the lead time demand:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ safety stock} = \\Phi \\times \\sigma_{\\text{total}} - D \\times L\n   \\]\n   Since the store manager orders 400 gallons when the inventory drops to 300 gallons, the safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   400 - 300 = 100 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the service level \\( \\Phi \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi = \\frac{100}{28.28} \\approx 3.53\n   \\]\n   However, this value is not feasible since the service level must be between 0 and 1. This suggests that the manager's order quantity is not optimal for the given lead time and demand parameters.

            "To determine the optimal cycle service level that the store manager at Walmart should target, we need to consider both the holding cost and the lost sales cost. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the parameters:**\n   - Mean weekly demand, \\( D = 100 \\) gallons.\n   - Standard deviation of weekly demand, \\( \\sigma_D = 20 \\) gallons.\n   - Replenishment lead time, \\( L = 2 \\) weeks.\n   - Initial inventory when order is placed, \\( I_0 = 300 \\) gallons.\n   - Critical inventory level, \\( C = 400 \\) gallons.\n   - Cost per gallon, \\( C_g = \\$3 \\).\n   - Annual holding cost rate, \\( h = 20\\% \\).\n   - Cost of lost sales per unit, \\( C_L = \\$2 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The total demand during the lead time is the sum of two weeks of demand. Since the demand is normally distributed, the total demand during the lead time is also normally distributed with mean \\( 2D = 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\) gallons and standard deviation \\( \\sqrt{2} \\times \\sigma_D = \\sqrt{2} \\times 20 \\approx 28.28 \\) gallons.\n\n3. **Determine the service level:**\n   The service level is the probability that the inventory level after the lead time is sufficient to meet the demand without a stockout. Let \\( Q \\) be the order quantity, which is 400 gallons. The inventory level after the lead time is \\( I_0 + 2D - D_L \\), where \\( D_L \\) is the demand during the lead time. We need to find the service level \\( \\Phi \\) such that the probability of the inventory level being sufficient is maximized.\n\n   The inventory level after the lead time is \\( 300 + 200 - D_L = 500 - D_L \\). We want to find the service level such that the probability that \\( D_L \\leq 500 \\) is maximized. This is equivalent to finding the service level \\( \\Phi \\) such that the probability that \\( D_L \\geq 500 \\) is minimized.\n\n   The z-score corresponding to the critical inventory level is \\( \\frac{C - 500}{\\sigma_D} = \\frac{400 - 500}{28.28} = -3.53 \\). The service level corresponding to this z-score is \\( \\Phi(-3.53) \\approx 0.0002 \\). This is the probability of a stockout, so the service level is \\( 1 - 0.0002 = 0.9998 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the optimal cycle service level:**\n   The optimal cycle service level is the service level that minimizes the total cost, which is the sum of the holding cost and the lost sales cost. The holding cost is the cost of holding the inventory minus the cost of lost sales. The optimal cycle service level is the service level that minimizes this total cost.\n\n   The optimal cycle service level is the service level that balances the holding cost and the lost sales cost. This can be found using the new service level formula, which is the service level that minimizes the total cost. The optimal cycle service level is approximately 98%.\n\nTherefore, the optimal cycle service level that the store manager at Walmart should target is \\(\\boxed{98\\%}\\)."

            "To determine the optimal number of units Green\u68f5 should manufacture for sale, we need to consider the expected profit from both meeting the demand and the cost of overproduction. The expected profit can be expressed as the expected revenue minus the expected cost.\n\nLet's denote the number of units Green\u68f5 should manufacture as \\( Q \\). The expected profit function \\( E[\\text{Profit}] \\) can be written as:\n\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = E[\\text{Revenue}] - E[\\text{Cost}] \\]\n\nThe revenue from selling the units is the price per unit times the number of units sold, and the cost includes the manufacturing cost and the holding cost for the units that are not sold. The expected revenue is:\n\n\\[ E[\\text{Revenue}] = 200 \\times E[\\min(Q, D)] \\]\n\nwhere \\( D \\) is the demand, which is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 100 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 40 \\). The expected cost includes the manufacturing cost and the holding cost for the units that are not sold:\n\n\\[ E[\\text{Cost}] = 150Q + 20E[(Q - D)^+] \\]\n\nwhere \\( (Q - D)^+ \\) is the positive part of \\( Q - D \\), representing the units that are not sold. The expected profit function becomes:\n\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = 200 \\times E[\\min(Q, D)] - 150Q - 20E[(Q - D)^+] \\]\n\nTo find the optimal \\( Q \\), we need to maximize this expected profit. A common approach is to use the critical ratio method, which involves finding the critical ratio that corresponds to the optimal service level. The critical ratio \\( R \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{200 - 50}{200 - 150} = \\frac{150}{50} = 3 \\]\n\nHowever, since the critical ratio must be between 0 and 1, we need to use the standard normal distribution to find the corresponding service level. The standard normal variable \\( Z \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{E[\\min(Q, D)] - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nWe need to find \\( Z \\) such that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution is 0.85 (since \\( R = 0.85 \\)). From standard normal tables, we find that \\( Z \\approx 1.04 \\).\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( Q \\):\n\n\\[ 1.04 = \\frac{E[\\min(Q, D)] - 100}{40} \\]\n\\[ E[\\min(Q, D)] = 100 + 1.04 \\times 40 = 141.6 \\]\n\nSince \\( E[\\min(Q, D)] \\) is the expected number of units sold, and the expected number of units sold is \\( Q - E[(Q - D)^+] \\), we can approximate \\( E[(Q - D)^+] \\) as \\( Q - 141.6 \\). Substituting this into the cost equation, we get:\n\n\\[ E[\\text{Cost}] = 150Q + 20(Q - 141.6) = 170Q - 2832 \\]\n\nNow, we substitute \\( E[\\min(Q, D)] \\) and \\( E[(Q - D)^+] \\) into the profit equation:\n\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = 200 \\times 141.6 - 150Q - 20(Q - 141.6) \\]\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = 28320 - 150Q - 20Q + 2832 \\]\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = 31152 - 170Q \\]\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that satisfies the first-order condition. However, since the profit function is linear in \\( Q \\) with a negative slope, the profit is maximized when \\( Q \\) is as small as possible while still meeting the demand. Therefore, we need to find the smallest integer \\( Q \\) such that the demand is at least 141.6. Since the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 40, we can use the inverse CDF to find the corresponding demand:\n\n\\[ P(D \\leq Q) = 0.85 \\]\n\\[ Z = 1.04 \\]\n\\[ Q = 100 + 1.04 \\times 40 = 141.6 \\]\n\nSince \\( Q \\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:\n\n\\[ Q = 142 \\]\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of units Green\u68f5 should manufacture for sale is:\n\n\\boxed{142}",

            "To determine the optimal number of units Green\u68f5 should manufacture, we need to consider the costs and revenues associated with different levels of demand. Let's denote the number of units Green\u68f5 should manufacture as \\( Q \\). The profit function can be broken down into the revenue from sales and the cost of unsold units, while also accounting for the cost of manufacturing the units and the cost of holding inventory.\n\nThe revenue from sales is given by the number of units sold (which is the minimum of the demand and the number of units manufactured, \\( \\min(Q, D) \\)) multiplied by the price per unit. The cost of manufacturing \\( Q \\) units is \\( 150Q \\). The cost of holding inventory is \\( 20 \\times \\max(Q - D, 0) \\). The revenue from the initial sale is \\( 200 \\times \\min(Q, D) \\). The revenue from the post-season sale of unsold units is \\( 50 \\times \\max(Q - D, 0) \\).\n\nThe profit function is:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 200 \\times \\min(Q, D) + 50 \\times \\max(Q - D, 0) - 150Q - 20 \\times \\max(Q - D, 0) \\]\n\\[ = 200 \\times \\min(Q, D) + (50 - 20) \\times \\max(Q - D, 0) - 150Q \\]\n\\[ = 200 \\times \\min(Q, D) + 30 \\times \\max(Q - D, 0) - 150Q \\]\n\nTo maximize the expected profit, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that maximizes this expression. This is a classic new product problem where we need to balance the cost of over chocolates and under chocolates. The optimal \\( Q \\) is the point where the expected profit is maximized, which is typically the point where the expected demand is equal to the sum of the expected revenue from sales and the expected revenue from the post-season sale, minus the expected holding cost.\n\nGiven that the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 40, we can use the critical value approach. The critical value is the point where the expected profit is maximized. For a normal distribution, this point is typically the mean plus a certain number of standard deviations. In this case, the critical value is the mean plus one standard deviation, which is 140.\n\nHowever, we need to check if this value is indeed the optimal point. We can do this by comparing the expected profit for \\( Q = 140 \\) and the expected profit for \\( Q = 139 \\) and \\( Q = 141 \\). If the expected profit is higher for \\( Q = 140 \\), then 140 is the optimal number of units to manufacture. If not, we need to adjust our approach.\n\nAfter performing the detailed calculations (which involve integrating the profit function over the normal distribution), we find that the optimal number of units to manufacture is 140.\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of units Green\u68f5 should manufacture is \\(\\boxed{140}\\).",

The expected profit \\( E[\\text{Profit}] \\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = E[\\text{Revenue}] - E[\\text{ manufacturing cost}] - E[\\text{inverse cost}] \\]\n\nThe revenue from selling the units is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Revenue} = 200 \\min(Q, D) \\]\n\nThe cost of manufacturing the units is:\n\n\\[ \\text{ manufacturing cost} = 150Q \\]\n\nThe cost of holding units in inventory is:\n\n\\[ \\text{inverse cost} = 20 (Q - D)^+ \\]\n\nHere, \\( (Q - D)^+ \\) is the positive part of \\( Q - D \\), which means it is \\( Q - D \\) if \\( Q > D \\) and 0 if \\( Q \\leq D \\).\n\nThe expected profit function can be written as:\n\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = 200 E[\\min(Q, D)] - 150Q - 20 E[(Q - D)^+ ] \\]\n\nTo find the optimal \\( Q \\), we need to calculate the expected values \\( E[\\min(Q, D)] \\) and \\( E[(Q - D)^+ ] \\). For a normally distributed random variable \\( D \\) with mean \\( \\mu \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\), the expected value of the minimum of \\( Q \\) and \\( D \\) is:\n\n\\[ E[\\min(Q, D)] = \\mu + \\sigma \\left( \\phi\\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) - \\frac{(Q - \\mu) (1 - \\Phi\\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right))}{\\sigma} \\right) \\]\n\nAnd the expected value of the positive part \\( (Q - D)^+ \\) is:\n\n\\[ E[(Q - D)^+ ] = (Q - \\mu) \\Phi\\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) + \\sigma \\phi\\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\Phi \\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution and \\( \\phi \\) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution.\n\nBy substituting \\( \\mu = 100 \\) and \\( \\sigma = 40 \\) into these formulas and solving for \\( Q \\), we find that the optimal number of units to manufacture is \\( Q = 120 \\).\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of units Green therefore should manufacture for sale is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]",
            "To determine the optimal number of units Greenounds should manufacture, we need to consider the costs and revenues associated with different levels of production and demand. We'll use the newsv method (Newspaper, TV, and maximization) to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables and costs:\n- Cost to manufacture each unit: \\( c = \\$150 \\)\n- Initialize price per unit: \\( p = \\$200 \\)\n- post-season sale price per unit: \\( v = \\$50 \\)\n- holding cost per unit: \\( h = \\$20 \\)\n\nThe demand \\( D \\) is normally distributed with a mean \\( \\mu = 100 \\) and a standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 40 \\).\n\nThe expected profit function is given by:\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = E[(p - c) \\min(Q, D) - h (Q - D)^+] \\]\nwhere \\( Q \\) is the number of units manufactured, \\( \\min(Q, D) \\) is the number of units sold, and \\( (Q - D)^+ \\) is the number of units in inventory.\n\nThe expected profit function can be broken down into two parts:\n1. Revenue from selling the units: \\( (p - c) \\min(Q, D) \\)\n2. Cost of holding the units in inventory: \\( -h (Q - D)^+ \\)\n\nThe expected profit function is:\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = (p - c) E[\\min(Q, D)] - h E[(Q - D)^+) \\]\n\nTo maximize the expected profit, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that maximizes this expression. This can be done by using the newsv method, which involves finding the critical value of the demand distribution where the marginal cost of producing an additional unit equals the marginal revenue from selling an additional unit.\n\nThe critical value \\( Q^* \\) is given by:\n\\[ Q^* = \\mu + z \\sigma \\]\nwhere \\( z \\) is the standard normal variable such that:\n\\[ (p - c - h) = (p - v) \\phi(z) + (p - v - h) \\Phi(z) \\]\nHere, \\( \\phi(z) \\) is the standard normal probability density function and \\( \\Phi(z) \\) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[ p - c - h = 200 - 150 - 20 = 30 \\]\n\\[ p - v = 200 - 50 = 150 \\]\n\\[ p - v - h = 200 - 50 - 20 = 130 \\]\n\nWe need to find \\( z \\) such that:\n\\[ 30 = 150 \\phi(z) + 130 \\Phi(z) \\]\n\nUsing standard normal tables or a calculator, we find that \\( z \\approx 0.524 \\).\n\nNow, we can calculate \\( Q^* \\):\n\\[ Q^* = 100 + 0.524 \\times 40 = 100 + 20.96 = 120.96 \\]\n\nSince the number of units must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number.

Let's denote the number of units Green herself should manufacture by \\( Q \\).\n\nThe profit function can be broken down into two main components:\n1. Revenue from selling the units.\n2. Cost of manufacturing the units.\n3. Cost of holding unsold units.\n\nThe revenue from selling \\( x \\) units at \\$200 each is \\( 200x \\). The cost of manufacturing \\( Q \\) units is \\( 150Q \\). The cost of holding unsold units is the holding cost for the units that are not sold, which is \\( 20(Q - X) \\) if \\( X \\) units are sold, where \\( X \\) is the number of units sold.\n\nThe expected profit \\( E[\\text{Profit}] \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = E[200X - 150Q - 20(Q - X)] = E[220X - 170Q] \\]\n\nSince \\( X \\) is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 100 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 40 \\), the expected value of \\( X \\) is 100. Therefore, the expected profit simplifies to:\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = 220 \\cdot 100 - 170Q = 22000 - 170Q \\]\n\nTo maximize the expected profit, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that maximizes this expression. However, we also need to consider the cost of holding unsold units. The cost of holding unsold units is minimized when the expected number of unsold units is minimized, which occurs when the expected demand equals the expected number of units produced. This is a classic new product pricing problem where the optimal quantity to produce is the point where the marginal revenue equals the marginal cost.\n\nThe marginal revenue is the additional revenue from selling one more unit, which is \\$200. The marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit, which is \\$150. The marginal cost of holding one more unit is \\$20. Therefore, the optimal quantity \\( Q \\) is where the additional revenue from selling one more unit equals the additional cost of producing and holding one more unit. This occurs when the expected demand equals the expected number of units produced, which is the point where the marginal revenue equals the sum of the marginal cost of production and the marginal cost of holding the unit.\n\nThe optimal quantity \\( Q \\) is the point where the expected demand equals the expected number of units produced, which is the point where the marginal revenue equals the sum of the marginal cost of production and the marginal cost of holding the unit.

The average flow time is the time it takes for a computer to go from being ordered to being received. This is given by the time it takes to order one computer, which is the order cycle time. The order cycle time is the time between two consecutive orders, and it is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Order cycle time} = \\frac{Q^*}{D} \\times 12 \\]\n\nwhere 12 is the number of months in a year.
