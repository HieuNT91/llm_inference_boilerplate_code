            "To determine the average cell phone inventory, we need to consider both the lead time and the reorder point. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of phones used during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 2 weeks, and the average number of phones used per week is 500. Therefore, the total number of phones used in 2 weeks is:\n   \\[\n   500 \\text{ phones/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 1000 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of phones ordered when the inventory reaches the reorder point:**\n   The reorder point is 1100 phones. This means that when the inventory reaches 1100 phones, Mr. Barksdale will order 125 phones to bring the inventory back up to the lot size of 125 phones plus the number of phones used during the lead time.\n\n3. **Calculate the average inventory:**\n   The average inventory is the average number of phones in the system over time. This can be calculated as the sum of the initial inventory and the number of phones ordered divided by 2, minus the number of phones used during the lead time. However, a simpler way to calculate the average inventory is to use the formula for the average inventory in a periodic review system:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average inventory} = \\text{Reorder point} - \\text{ lead time} \\times \\text{average number of phones used per week}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average inventory} = 1100 \\text{ phones} - 1000 \\text{ phones} = 100 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average cell phone inventory is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",

            "To determine the safety inventory of paper towels that Target should carry, we need to calculate the safety stock that corresponds to a 99% fill rate. Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand over the two-week lead time:**\n   The weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 300. Over two weeks, the mean demand is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 1000 = 2000\n   \\]\n   The standard deviation of the demand over two weeks is:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{2} \\times 300 = 300\\sqrt{2} \\approx 424.26\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the demand over the two-week lead time is normally distributed with a mean of 2000 and a standard deviation of 424.26.\n\n2. **Determine the safety stock corresponding to a 99% fill rate:**\n   We need to find the value of the demand that corresponds to the 99th percentile of the normal distribution. This can be done using the Z-score for the 99th percentile, which is approximately 2.33. The Z-score formula is:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n   \\]\n   where \\(X\\) is the value we want to find, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean, and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation. Plugging in the values, we get:\n   \\[\n   2.33 = \\frac{X - 2000}{424.26}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(X\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   X = 2000 + 2.33 \\times 424.26 \\approx 2000 + 989.96 \\approx 2989.96\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the safety stock should be approximately 2990 paper towels.\n\n3. **Calculate the total safety inventory:**\n   The safety inventory is the safety stock minus the expected demand over the lead time. Since the expected demand over the lead time is 2000 paper towels, the safety inventory is:\n   \\[\n   2990 - 2000 = 990\n   \\]\n\nThus, the safety inventory of paper towels that Target should carry is \\(\\boxed{990}\\).",

The number of orders placed per cycle is the ratio of the reorder point to the lot size.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of orders per cycle} = \\frac{2000 \\text{ phones}}{125 \\text{ phones/order}} = 16 \\text{ orders}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the time between orders:**\n   Since there are 16 orders per cycle and the lead time is 2 weeks, the time between orders is the total lead time divided by the number of orders.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time between orders} = \\frac{2 \\text{ weeks}}{16 \\text{ orders}} = 0.125 \\text{ weeks/order}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the average flow time per phone:**\n   The average flow time per phone is the time between orders multiplied by the average time it takes to use up a single order. The average time it takes to use up a single order is the lead time divided by the number of orders.\n   However, since the lead time is already given and the orders are placed when the stock is at the reorder point, the average flow time per phone is simply the time it takes to use up the lead time divided by the number of phones used in that time.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average flow time per phone} = \\frac{\\text{Total demand during lead time}}{\\text{Lot size}} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ phones}}{125 \\text{ phones}} = 8 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average flow time of a phone is \\boxed{8} weeks.",
            "To determine the average flow time of a phone, we need to consider both the lead time and the time it takes for a phone to be sold and replaced. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of phones sold per week:**\n   The operation uses 500 pre paid cell phones per week.\n\n2. **Determine the lead time in weeks:**\n   The lead time for the phones is 2 weeks.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of phones sold during the lead time:**\n   Since the operation uses 500 phones per week, in 2 weeks it will use:\n   \\[\n   500 \\text{ phones/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 1000 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of phones in stock when a new order is placed:**\n   The reorder point is 2000 phones. When a new order is placed, the operation already has 125 phones in stock. Therefore, the number of phones that need to be ordered to reach the reorder point is:\n   \\[\n   2000 \\text{ phones} - 125 \\text{ phones} = 1875 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n   Since the operation uses 500 phones per week, the time it takes to sell 1875 phones is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1875 \\text{ phones}}{500 \\text{ phones/week}} = 3.75 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total flow time:**\n   The total flow time is the sum of the lead time and the time it takes to sell the phones after the order is placed:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ weeks} + 3.75 \\text{ weeks} = 5.75 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average flow time of a phone is \\(\\boxed{5.75}\\) weeks.",
            "To determine the average flow time of a phone, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of phones used in two weeks:**\n   The operation uses an average of 500 phones per week. Therefore, in two weeks, the total number of phones used is:\n   \\[\n   500 \\text{ phones/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 1000 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of phones needed when the order is placed:**\n   The lead time for the phones is two weeks, so when the order is placed, there are already 2000 phones in the system (the reorder point).\n\n3. **Calculate the number of phones that will be used while the order is being filled:**\n   Since the order is for 125 phones and the lead time is two weeks, the number of phones used while the order is being filled is the total number of phones used in two weeks, which is 1000 phones. However, the order size is only 125 phones, so the number of phones used while the order is being filled is limited to 125 phones.\n\n4. **Determine the total time taken for the order to be filled:**\n   The order will take two weeks to be filled because the lead time is two weeks. Since the order size is 125 phones and the average number of phones used per week is 500, the time taken to use 125 phones is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{125 \\text{ phones}}{500 \\text{ phones/week}} = 0.25 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total time taken for the order to be filled is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ weeks} + 0.25 \\text{ weeks} = 2.25 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the average flow time of a phone:**\n   The average flow time of a phone is the total time taken for the order to be filled divided by the number of phones ordered.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 3 weeks, and the weekly demand is 200 bananas. Therefore, the total demand during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   200 \\text{ bananas/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory and the order quantity:**\n   The initial inventory is 600 bananas, and the order quantity is 1000 bananas. After the order is placed, the total inventory will be:\n   \\[\n   600 \\text{ bananas} + 1000 \\text{ bananas} = 1600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the minimum inventory level required to meet the demand:**\n   To ensure that the inventory does not run out before the next replenishment arrives, the minimum inventory level required is equal to the total demand during the lead time, which is 600 bananas.\n\n4. **Determine the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is the difference between the initial inventory after the order is placed and the minimum inventory level required:\n   \\[\n   1600 \\text{ bananas} - 600 \\text{ bananas} = 1000 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the standard deviation of the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The standard deviation of the weekly demand is 50 bananas.

            "To determine the customer service level, we need to calculate the probability that the inventory will not run out before the next replenishment arrives.

Therefore, the total inventory immediately after the order is:\n   \\[\n   600 + 1000 = 1600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the minimum inventory level to avoid stockout:**\n   The minimum inventory level to avoid stockout is the total demand during the lead time, which is 600 bananas.\n\n4. **Determine the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is the difference between the initial inventory and the minimum inventory level to avoid stockout. However, since the initial inventory after the order is 1600 bananas, we need to consider the lead time demand and the safety stock to ensure we do not run out before the next replenishment. The safety stock is calculated based on the lead time demand and the standard deviation of the demand:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = Z \\times \\sigma_{\\text{lead time}}\n   \\]\n   where \\( Z \\) is the Z-score corresponding to the desired customer service level and \\( \\sigma_{\\text{lead time}} \\) is the standard deviation of the demand over the lead time.\n   The standard deviation of the demand over the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{\\text{lead time}} = \\sqrt{3} \\times 50 = 50\\sqrt{3} \\approx 86.60 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Set up the equation for the initial inventory:**\n   The initial inventory after the order is the sum of the minimum inventory level to avoid stockout and the safety stock:\n   \\[\n   1600 = 600 + 86.60Z\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( Z \\):\n   \\[\n   1000 = 86.60Z \\implies Z = \\frac{1000}{86.60} \\approx 11.54\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find the customer service level:**\n   The Z-score of 11.54 corresponds to a customer service level of approximately 100%.

            "To determine the customer service level, we need to calculate the probability that the inventory will not be back to zero before the next order arrives. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand over the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 3 weeks, and the weekly demand is 200 bananas with a standard deviation of 50. Therefore, the total demand over the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total demand} = 3 \\times 200 = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   The standard deviation of the total demand over the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Standard deviation of total demand} = \\sqrt{3} \\times 50 \\approx 86.60 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory and the order quantity:**\n   The initial inventory when the order is placed is 600 bananas, and the order quantity is 1000 bananas. Therefore, the total inventory immediately after the order is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total inventory} = 600 + 1000 = 1600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the probability that the inventory will not be back to zero before the next order arrives:**\n   We need to find the probability that the total demand over the lead time is less than or equal to the initial inventory (1600 bananas). This is equivalent to finding the probability that a normal random variable with mean 600 and standard deviation 86.60 is less than or equal to 1600. We can standardize this value using the z-score:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{1600 - 600}{86.60} \\approx 11.54\n   \\]\n   The probability that a standard normal random variable is less than or equal to 11.54 is essentially 1 (since 11.54 is far in the right tail of the distribution).\n\nTherefore, the customer service level is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",
            "To determine the customer service level, we need to calculate the probability that the inventory will not run out before the next replenishment. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 3 weeks, and the weekly demand is 200 bananas. Therefore, the total demand during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 200 = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory before the order arrives:**\n   The initial inventory is 600 bananas.\n\n3. **Calculate the inventory level just before the order arrives:**\n   Since the order is 1000 bananas, the inventory level just before the order arrives is:\n   \\[\n   600 - 600 = 0 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   This means that the inventory will start at 0 bananas and increase to 1000 bananas when the order arrives.\n\n4. **Calculate the probability that the inventory will run out before the next replenishment:**\n   The inventory will run out if the demand during the lead time exceeds the initial inventory before the order arrives. Since the initial inventory before the order arrives is 0, the inventory will run out if the demand during the lead time is greater than 0. However, we need to consider the lead time demand distribution.\n\n   The lead time demand is normally distributed with a mean of 600 bananas and a standard deviation of:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{3} \\times 50 = 50\\sqrt{3} \\approx 86.60 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   We need to find the probability that the demand is less than or equal to 600 bananas, which is the same as finding the probability that a standard normal variable \\( Z \\) is less than or equal to 0:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{600 - 600}{86.60} = 0\n   \\]\n   The probability that \\( Z \\) is less than or equal to 0 is 0.50. Therefore, the probability that the inventory will not run out before the next replenishment is:\n   \\[\n   1 - 0.50 = 0.50\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert the probability to a customer service level:**\n   The customer service level is the probability that the inventory will not run out before the next replenishment. Therefore, the customer service level is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0.50}\n   \\]",

So, the initial inventory at the time of the order is 600 bananas.\n\n3. **Calculate the inventory level just before the lead time ends:**\n   After the lead time, the inventory will be the initial inventory minus the total demand during the lead time:\n   \\[\n   600 \\text{ bananas} - 600 \\text{ bananas} = 0 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   This means that the inventory will be zero just before the lead time ends if no additional bananas are ordered.\n\n4. **Determine the safety stock needed:**\n   To ensure that the inventory does not run out during the lead time, the safety stock should be equal to the total demand during the lead time. Therefore, the safety stock needed is:\n   \\[\n   600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the probability that the inventory will not run out:**\n   The safety stock is 600 bananas, and the standard deviation of the total demand during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ bananas/week} \\times \\sqrt{3} = 50 \\times 1.732 = 86.6 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   The probability that the total demand during the lead time will be less than or equal to 600 bananas is the same as the probability that the standard normal variable \\( Z \\) is less than or equal to:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{600 - 600}{86.6} = 0\n   \\]\n   From the standard normal distribution table, the probability that \\( Z \\) is less than or equal to 0 is 0.5. Therefore, the customer service level is:\n   \\[\n   0.50 = 50\\%\n   \\]\n\nThe customer service level is \\(\\boxed{50\\%}\\).",

Therefore, the total inventory after placing the order is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total inventory} = 600 + 1000 = 1600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   The inventory level at the time the lead time ends will be the initial inventory minus the total demand during the lead time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory level at lead time end} = 1600 - 600 = 1000 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   The Banana Stand manager will place a new order when the inventory drops to 600 bananas. Therefore, the inventory level at the time the lead time ends must be at least 600 bananas to avoid stockout. The safety stock needed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ Safety stock} = 600 - (1600 - 600) = 600 - 1000 + 600 = 200 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   However, since we need to find the probability that the inventory will not run out, we need to calculate the probability that the total demand during the lead time is less than or equal to 1000 bananas. This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Total demand} \\leq 1000) = P\\left(Z \\leq \\frac{1000 - 600}{86.60}\\right) = P\\left(Z \\leq \\frac{400}{86.60}\\right) = P(Z \\leq 4.61)\n   \\]\n   Using the standard normal distribution table, we find that:\n   \\[\n   P(Z \\leq 4.61) \\approx 1\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the probability that the inventory will not run out is 1, and the customer service level is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{1}\n   \\]",

Therefore, the total inventory available before the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total inventory} = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   The order will be placed when the inventory drops to 600, so the inventory level just before the lead time is 600 bananas. After the lead time, the inventory level will be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory level after lead time} = 600 \\text{ bananas} - 600 \\text{ bananas} = 0 \\text{ bananas} + \\text{order quantity} - \\text{total demand} = 1000 - 600 = 400 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is the amount of inventory needed to ensure that the inventory does not run out during the lead time. The safety stock can be calculated using the standard normal distribution. We need to find the z-score corresponding to the probability that the total demand during the lead time does not exceed the initial inventory plus the safety stock. The safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = z \\times \\text{Standard deviation of total demand}\n   \\]\n   where \\( z \\) is the z-score corresponding to the desired service level. The initial inventory is 600 bananas, and the total demand during the lead time is 600 bananas, so the safety stock needed to ensure that the inventory does not run out is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = 400 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   The z-score corresponding to this safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{400 - 600}{86.6} = -2.31\n   \\]\n   The probability corresponding to a z-score of -2.31 is 0.9894, which means the service level is 98.94%.\n\nTherefore, the customer service level is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{98.94\\%}\n\\]",

Since the manager orders when the inventory drops to 600, the target inventory is 600 bananas.\n\n4. **Determine the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is the difference between the target inventory and the expected demand during the lead time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = 600 - 600 = 0 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   Since the safety stock is 0, the inventory will not have any safety stock to account for the variability in demand. However, this approach is incorrect because we need to consider the variability in demand to determine the customer service level. Let's correct this by considering the total inventory and the lead time demand.\n\n   The safety stock should be calculated based on the total inventory and the lead time demand:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ safety stock} = 1600 - 200 \\times 1 = 400 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the z-score:**\n   The z-score is the number of standard deviations the safety stock is from the expected demand during the lead time. The z-score is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{\\text{ safety stock}}{\\text{ standard deviation of total demand}} = \\frac{400 - 600}{86.60} = \\frac{100}{86.60} \\approx 1.15\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the customer service level:**\n   The customer service level is the probability that the z-score is less than or equal to 1.15. Using a standard normal distribution table, we find that the probability corresponding to a z-score of 1.15 is approximately 0.8749. Therefore, the customer service level is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Customer service level} = 0.8749 \\approx 87.49\\%\n   \\]\n\nThe correct approach is to dutyinerary Cyr }\n\n\n\n\n\n diarr SEEK#+legate

            "To determine the service level (CSL) that the store achieves, we need to calculate the probability that the store will not run out of shampoo during the lead time. The lead time is two weeks, so we need to find the probability that the total demand over two weeks is less than or equal to the initial inventory plus the order quantity.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total demand over two weeks. Since the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 2,800 and a standard deviation of 1,000, the total demand over two weeks will also be normally distributed with a mean of:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2800 = 5600 \\]\nand a standard deviation of:\n\\[ \\sqrt{2} \\times 1000 = 1000\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1414.21 \\]\n\nThe store manager orders 11,000 units when there are 8,500 units in inventory. Therefore, the initial inventory plus the order quantity is:\n\\[ 8500 + 11000 = 19500 \\]\n\nWe need to find the probability that the total demand over two weeks is less than or equal to 19500. This is equivalent to finding the probability that a normally distributed random variable with a mean of 5600 and a standard deviation of 1414.21 is less than or equal to 19500. We can standardize this value by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation:\n\\[ Z = \\frac{19500 - 5600}{1414.21} \\approx \\frac{13900}{1414.21} \\approx 9.83 \\]\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the probability that a standard normal random variable is less than or equal to 9.83 is essentially 1 (since 9.83 is far in the right tail of the distribution).

We will use the newsvendor model, which is commonly used in inventory management for products with uncertain demand.\n\nLet's define the following variables:\n- \\( D \\): Demand for ornaments, which is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 20,000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 8,000 \\).\n- \\( Q \\): Number of ornaments ordered.\n- \\( c \\): Cost per ornament, which is \\$30.\n- \\( p \\): Selling price per ornament, which is \\$95.\n- \\( h \\): holding cost per unsold ornament, which is \\$0 (since unsold ornaments are destroyed).\n- \\( \\alpha \\): critical ratio, which is the ratio of the profit from selling an ornament to the profit from selling an ornament plus the holding cost.\n\nFirst, we calculate the profit per ornament sold and the profit per ornament not sold:\n- Profit per ornament sold: \\( p - c = 95 - 30 = 65 \\).\n- Profit per ornament not sold: \\( -c = -30 \\) (since unsold ornaments are destroyed).\n\nThe critical ratio \\( \\alpha \\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\text{Profit per ornament sold}}{\\text{Profit per ornament sold} + \\text{Profit per ornament not sold}} = \\frac{65}{65 + 0} = 1\n\\]\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with normally distributed demand, we need to use the standard normal distribution to find the optimal order quantity. The critical ratio for normally distributed demand is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.\n\nThe critical ratio \\( \\alpha \\) is:\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\frac{65}{65 + 135} = 1\n\\]\n\nTo find the optimal order quantity \\( Q \\), we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) such that the probability of demand being less than or equal to \\( Q \\) is equal to \\( \\alpha \\). This is done by finding the z-score corresponding to \\( \\alpha \\) in the standard normal distribution.\n\nThe z-score corresponding to \\( \\alpha \\) is:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( Q \\), we need to find the z-score corresponding to the desired critical ratio. This is done by finding the z-score corresponding to \\( \\alpha \\) in the standard normal distribution.\n\n\\[\nQ = \\mu + z \\sigma\n\\]\n\nFinally, we need to find the value of \\( z \\) corresponding to the desired critical ratio. This is done by finding the z-score corresponding to \\( \\alpha \\) in the standard normal distribution.\n\n\\[\nQ = 20,000 + 0.5 \\times 8,000 = 20,000 + 4,000 = 24,000\n]\n\nTherefore, the designer should order \\boxed{24,000} ornaments."

            "To determine the cost of understocking at the Banana Stand, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 3 weeks, and the weekly demand is 200 bananas.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total demand} = 3 \\times 200 = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is calculated using the formula for the safety stock based on the standard deviation of demand and the lead time. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ safety stock} = z \\times \\sigma_{\\text{lead time}}\n   \\]\n   where \\( z \\) is the z-score corresponding to the desired service level, and \\( \\sigma_{\\text{lead time}} \\) is the standard deviation of demand over the lead time.\n\n   First, we need to find \\( \\sigma_{\\text{lead time}} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{\\text{lead time}} = \\sqrt{3} \\times 50 \\approx 86.60 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n   Next, we need to determine the z-score. Since the problem does not specify a service level, we will assume a common service level of 95%, which corresponds to a z-score of approximately 1.645.\n\n   Now, calculate the safety stock:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ safety stock} = 1.645 \\times 86.60 \\approx 142.37 \\approx 142 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the target inventory level:**\n   The target inventory level is the sum of the safety stock and the total demand during the lead time.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Target inventory level} = 600 + 142 = 742 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the understocking cost:**\n   The Banana Stand manager orders 1000 bananas when the inventory drops to 600. The understocking occurs if the inventory level falls below the target level of 742 bananas.\n\n   The understocking level is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Understocking level} = 742 - 600 = 142 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n   The holding cost per banana is 40% of the cost of one banana:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Holding cost per banana} = 0.40 \\times 0.50 = 0.20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n   The understocking cost is the holding cost per banana multiplied by the understocking level:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Understocking cost} = 142 \\times 0.20 = 28.40 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of understocking is \\(\\boxed{28.40}\\).",

However, we need to check the cumulative probability for this z-score. Using standard normal distribution tables or a calculator:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Service level} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\times 4.62 \\times e^{-4.62^2/2}} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{6.28

\\text{Total demand} - (\\text{ lead time demand} + \\text{\u5b89\u5168 stock})\n   \\]\n   Since the lead time demand is 600 and the safety stock is 400, the expected stockouts per cycle are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected stockouts per cycle} = 1000 - (600 + 400) = 0\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the average number of stockouts per year:**\n   Since the lead time is 3 weeks, there are \\( \\frac{52}{3} \\approx 17.33 \\) cycles per year.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average number of stockouts per year} = \\text{Expected stockouts per cycle} \\times \\text{Cycles per year}\n   \\]\n\n7.

            "To determine the cost of understocking, we need to calculate the expected number of bananas that will be short each week and then multiply this by the cost of each banana.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total demand over the replenishment lead time. The lead time is 3 weeks, and the weekly demand is 200 bananas. Therefore, the total demand over 3 weeks is:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ bananas/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 600 \\text{ bananas} \\]\n\nThe Banana Stand manager orders 1000 bananas when the inventory drops to 600. This means that if the inventory is 600 bananas, the manager will order 1000 bananas, which will cover the demand of 600 bananas over the next 3 weeks. However, if the inventory drops below 600 bananas during this period, the manager will still order 1000 bananas, but the actual demand will be greater than 600 bananas, resulting in a shortage.\n\nThe inventory level at the beginning of the lead time is 600 bananas. The demand over the lead time is a normal distribution with a mean of 600 bananas and a standard deviation of:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ bananas/week} \\times \\sqrt{3 \\text{ weeks}} = 50 \\times \\sqrt{3} \\approx 86.60 \\text{ bananas} \\]\n\nWe need to find the probability that the demand over the lead time exceeds 600 bananas. Since the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 600 and a standard deviation of 86.60, we can standardize the value of 600 using the z-score formula:\n\\[ z = \\frac{600 - 600}{86.60} = 0 \\]\n\nThe z-score of 0 corresponds to the mean of the distribution. The probability that the demand is less than or equal to 600 bananas is 0.5 (since the normal distribution is symmetric around the mean). Therefore, the probability that the demand exceeds 600 bananas is:\n\\[ 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 \\]\n\nThe expected number of bananas short each week is the probability that the demand exceeds 600 bananas multiplied by the difference between the demand and 600 bananas. However, since the demand is exactly 600 bananas when the inventory drops to 600, the expected number of bananas short each week is 0.\n\nThe cost of understocking is the expected number of bananas short each week multiplied by the cost of each banana. Since the expected number of bananas short each week is 0, the cost of understocking is:\n\\[ 0 \\times 0.50 = 0 \\]\n\nHowever, this is not correct because we need to consider the probability of understocking and the actual number of bananas short when the demand exceeds 600.\n\n correctly we need to consider the probability of understocking and the actual number of bananas short when the demand exceeds 600.

            "To determine the cost of understocking, we need to calculate the expected cost of stockouts over the year. Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand over the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 3 weeks, and the weekly demand is 200 bananas. Therefore, the total demand over the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 200 = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the safety stock:**\n   The Banana Stand manager orders 1000 bananas when the inventory drops to 600. This means the safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   1000 - 600 = 400 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   However, since the lead time demand is 600 bananas, the safety stock needed to ensure no stockouts would be the lead time demand minus the initial inventory level when an order is placed. Since the initial inventory level is 600 and the lead time demand is also 600, the safety stock needed is actually 600 - 600 = 0. But since we are given that the manager orders 400 bananas when the inventory drops to 600, we need to calculate the probability that the demand will exceed 600 bananas during the lead time.\n\n3. **Calculate the probability of stockout:**\n   The demand during the lead time follows a normal distribution with a mean of 600 and a standard deviation of \\(50 \\times \\sqrt{3} = 86.60\\). We need to find the probability that the demand exceeds 600 bananas. This is equivalent to finding the probability that a standard normal variable \\(Z\\) is greater than \\(\\frac{600 - 600}{86.60} = 0\\). The probability that \\(Z > 0\\) is 0.5.\n\n4. **Calculate the expected number of stockouts per cycle:**\n   The expected number of stockouts per cycle is the probability of stockout multiplied by the lead time demand:\n   \\[\n   0.5 \\times 600 = 0.5 \\times 400 = 200 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the expected number of stockouts per year:**\n   The manager places an order every time the inventory drops to 600, and the lead time is 3 weeks. Therefore, the number of cycles per year is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{52 \\text{ weeks}}{3 \\text{ weeks/cycle}} = 17.33 \\approx 17 \\text{ cycles}\n   \\]\n   The expected number of stockouts per year is:\n   \\[\n   17 \\times 200 = 3400 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the cost of understocking:**\n   The holding cost is 40\\% of the cost of the bananas. Since each banana costs \\$0.50, the holding cost per banana is:\n   \\[\n   0.40 \\times 0.50 = 0.20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the cost of understocking is:\n   \\[\n   3400 \\times 0.20 = 680 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThe cost of understocking is \\(\\boxed{680}\\).",
            "To determine the cost of understocking, we need to calculate the expected number of bananas that will be short each week and then multiply that by the cost of each banana.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weekly demand over the 3-week replenishment lead time:\n\\[\n\\text{Total weekly demand} = 200 \\text{ bananas/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that the inventory will drop to 600 bananas before it is replenished. The inventory starts at 1000 bananas and is replenished with 1000 bananas, so the initial inventory is 1000 bananas. The inventory will drop to 600 bananas when the total demand over the 3 weeks exceeds 400 bananas. However, since the total demand is exactly 600 bananas, we need to consider the probability that the demand over the 3 weeks will be less than or equal to 600 bananas.\n\nThe demand over the 3 weeks follows a normal distribution with a mean of 600 bananas and a standard deviation of:\n\\[\n\\text{Standard deviation of total demand} = \\sqrt{3} \\times 50 = 50\\sqrt{3} \\approx 86.60 \\text{ bananas}\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the probability that the demand is less than or equal to 600 bananas. Since the mean of the distribution is 600, the probability that the demand is less than or equal to 600 bananas is 0.5 (or 50%).\n\nHowever, we need to find the probability that the demand is greater than 600 bananas. Since the probability that the demand is less than or equal to 600 bananas is 0.5, the probability that the demand is greater than 600 bananas is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{demand} > 600) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\\]\n\nThis means that there is a 50% chance that the demand will be greater than 600 bananas, and the inventory will drop to 600 bananas. If the demand is greater than 600 bananas, the number of bananas short each week is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of bananas short} = \\text{Demand} - 600\n\\]\n\nThe expected number of bananas short each week is:\n\\[\n\\text{Expected number of bananas short} = 0.5 \\times (\\text{Demand} - 600)\n\\]\nSince the demand follows a normal distribution with a mean of 600 and a standard deviation of 86.60, the expected value of the demand is 600. Therefore, the expected number of bananas short each week is:\n\\[\n\\text{Expected number of bananas short} = 0.5 \\times (600 - 600) + 0.5 \\times \\text{Expected value of demand beyond 600}\n\\]\nThe expected value of the demand beyond 600 is the same as the expected value of the demand minus 600, which is the standard deviation of the demand:\n\\[\n\\text{Expected number of bananas short} = 0.5 \\times 50\\sqrt{3} = 25\\sqrt{3} \\approx 25 \\times 1.732 = 43.30 \\text{ bananas}\n\\]\n\nThe cost of understocking is the expected number of bananas short each week multiplied by the cost of each banana:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of understocking} = 43.30 \\text{ bananas} \\times 0.50 \\text{ dollars/banana} = 21.65 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of understocking is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{21.65}\n\\]",
            "To determine the cost of understocking, we need to calculate the expected number of bananas that will be short each week and then multiply by the cost of each banana.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total demand over the replenishment lead time. Since the weekly demand is 200 bananas, the demand over 3 weeks is:\n\\[ 200 \\times 3 = 600 \\text{ bananas} \\]\n\nThe manager orders 1000 bananas when the inventory drops to 600. Therefore, if the inventory drops to 600, it will take 3 weeks to sell the 600 bananas that are already in the inventory. During these 3 weeks, the demand is 600 bananas, so the inventory will be down to 0 bananas at the end of the lead time.\n\nIf the inventory drops to 600 at the beginning of the lead time, the probability that the inventory will be down to 0 by the end of the lead time is 100%. This means there will be no stock left to meet the demand, and the number of bananas short each week is the total demand minus the initial inventory:\n\\[ 600 - 600 = 0 \\text{ bananas short per week} \\]\n\nHowever, this interpretation is incorrect because it assumes the inventory will always drop to 0. Instead, we need to consider the probability distribution of the demand over the lead time.\n\nThe demand over the lead time is normally distributed with a mean of 600 and a standard deviation of \\( 50 \\times \\sqrt{3} = 86.6 \\). We need to find the probability that the demand will be greater than 600 bananas.\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution, we calculate the z-score:\n\\[ z = \\frac{600 - 600}{86.6} = 0 \\]\n\nThe probability that the demand will be greater than 600 bananas is:\n\\[ P(Z > 0) = 0.5 \\]\n\nThis means there is a 50% chance that the demand will be greater than 600 bananas. When the demand is greater than 600 bananas, the number of bananas short is the demand minus 600. The expected number of bananas short per week is:\n\\[ 0.5 \\times (600 - 600) = 0 \\]\n\nThis is incorrect because we need to consider the actual demand distribution.

            "To determine the cost of understocking, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 3 weeks, and the weekly demand is 200 bananas.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total demand} = 3 \\times 200 = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is calculated using the formula for the safety stock in terms of the standard deviation of demand over the lead time and the desired service level. However, since the problem does not specify a service level, we will assume the manager is ordering based on the lead time demand and the initial inventory.\n\n   The initial inventory when the order is placed is 1000 bananas, and the inventory drops to 600 when the order is placed. Therefore, the safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = \\text{Initial inventory} - \\text{ inventory when order is placed} = 1000 - 600 = 400 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n   However, if we consider the lead time demand and the initial inventory, the safety stock should be equal to the lead time demand minus the initial inventory when the order is placed. This is a logical contradiction in this problem. Let's assume the safety stock is based on the lead time demand.\n\n   **\u6b63\u786e\u7684 safety stock should be 600 bananas ( lead time demand)**.\n\n   ** depended seed }\n\n\n\n\n\n])**-fashion

            "To determine the cost of understocking, we need to calculate the expected number of bananas that will be short each week and then find the total cost of these short bananas over the year.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weekly demand and its standard deviation over the replenishment lead time. The weekly demand is 200 bananas with a standard deviation of 50. Over a 3-week lead time, the total demand \\( D \\) is:\n\\[ D = 200 \\times 3 = 600 \\text{ bananas} \\]\nThe standard deviation of the total demand over 3 weeks \\( \\sigma_D \\) is:\n\\[ \\sigma_D = 50 \\times \\sqrt{3} = 50 \\times 1.732 = 86.6 \\text{ bananas} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that the inventory will be less than the demand during the lead time. The inventory level when an order is placed is 600 bananas, which is exactly the same as the expected demand over the lead time. Therefore, we need to find the probability that the demand will be greater than 600 bananas.\n\nWe standardize the demand to a z-score:\n\\[ z = \\frac{600 - 600}{86.6} = 0 \\]\nThe probability that the z-score is greater than 0 is 0.5 (since the normal distribution is symmetric around the mean).\n\nThis means there is a 50% chance that the demand will be greater than 600 bananas. The expected number of bananas short each week is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected number of bananas short} = 0.5 \\times (D - 600) = 0.5 \\times (600 - 600) = 0 \\text{ bananas per week} \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation is incorrect because we need to consider the actual lead time demand distribution and not just the mean. Let's correct this by finding the actual probability of stockout.\n\nThe correct approach is to use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution to find the probability that the demand exceeds the inventory level.\n\nUsing a z-score table or calculator:\n\\[ P(Z > \\frac{600 - 600}{86.6}) = P(Z > 0) = 0.5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected number of bananas short each week is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected number of bananas short} = 1000 - 600 - 200 = 200 \\text{ bananas per week}\n\nFinally, we calculate the cost of understocking. The cost of each banana is \\$0.50, and the holding cost is 40%. The total cost of understocking each week is:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of understocking per week} = 200 \\times 0.50 = 100 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe total cost of understocking over the year is:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost of understocking} = 100 \\times 52 = 200 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of understocking is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{500}\n\\]"

            "To determine the fill rate for the store, we need to calculate the probability that the store will have enough shampoo to meet the demand over the two-week period. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand over two weeks:**\n   The weekly demand for shampoo is normally distributed with a mean of 2,800 and a standard deviation of 1,000. Therefore, the total demand over two weeks is also normally distributed with a mean of \\(2 \\times 2800 = 5600\\) and a standard deviation of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\times 1000 = 1414.21 \\).\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory and the order quantity:**\n   The store starts with 8,500 units in inventory and orders 11,000 units when the inventory level drops to 8,500. Therefore, the total inventory available after the order is \\(8500 + 11000 = 19500\\) units.\n\n3. **Calculate the probability that the total demand over two weeks is less than or equal to the total inventory available:**\n   We need to find the probability that the total demand \\(D\\) is less than or equal to 19500. This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   P(D \\leq 19500)\n   \\]\n   To find this probability, we standardize the value 19500 using the mean and standard deviation of the total demand:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{19500 - 5600}{1414.21} = \\frac{13900}{1414.21} \\approx 9.83\n   \\]\n   The probability that a standard normal variable \\(Z\\) is less than or equal to 9.83 is essentially 1 (since 9.83 is far in the right tail of the standard normal distribution).\n\n4. **Determine the fill rate:**\n   The fill rate is the probability that the store will have enough shampoo to meet the demand over the two-week period.

This can be done by converting the value to a z-score and using the standard normal distribution table.\n   The z-score is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{19500 - 5600}{1414.21} = \\frac{13900}{1414.21} \\approx 9.83\n   \\]\n   The probability that a standard normal random variable is less than or equal to 9.83 is essentially 1 (since 9.83 is far in the right tail of the standard normal distribution).\n\nTherefore, the fill rate of the store is approximately \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",

Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand over two weeks:**\n   The weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 2,800 and a standard deviation of 1,000. Therefore, the total demand over two weeks is also normally distributed with a mean of:\n   \\[\n   \\mu_{\\text{2 weeks}} = 2 \\times 2800 = 5600\n   \\]\n   and a standard deviation of:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{\\text{2 weeks}} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 1000 = 1000\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1414.21\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory and the order quantity:**\n   The store starts with 8,500 units in inventory and orders 11,000 units when the inventory level drops to 8,500. Therefore, the total inventory available after the order is:\n   \\[\n   8500 + 11000 = 19500\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the probability that the total demand over two weeks is less than or equal to the total inventory available:**\n   We need to find the probability that the total demand \\( D \\) over two weeks is less than or equal to 19500. This is given by:\n   \\[\n   P(D \\leq 19500)\n   \\]\n   To find this probability, we standardize the value 19500 using the z-score formula:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{19500 - 5600}{1414.21} = \\frac{13900}{1414.21} \\approx 9.83\n   \\]\n   Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that:\n   \\[\n   P(Z \\leq 9.83) \\approx 1\n   \\]\n   This means that the probability that the total demand over two weeks is less than or equal to 19500 is essentially 1, or 100%.\n\nTherefore, the fill rate of the store is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",
            "To determine the fill rate for the store, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the lead time demand:**\n   Since the supplier takes 2 weeks to supply the order, we need to find the total demand over these 2 weeks. Given that the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 2,800 and a standard deviation of 1,000, the lead time demand is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Lead time demand} = 2 \\times \\text{Mean weekly demand} = 2 \\times 2800 = 5600\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory before the order arrives:**\n   The store manager orders 11,000 units when there are 8,500 units in inventory. Therefore, the initial inventory before the order arrives is 8,500 units.\n\n3. **Calculate the total inventory available before the new order arrives:**\n   The total inventory available before the new order arrives is the initial inventory plus the lead time demand:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total inventory available} = 8500 + 5600 = 14100\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the amount of inventory used:**\n   The store manager orders 11,000 units, so the amount of inventory used is 11,000 units.\n\n5. **Calculate the fill rate:**\n   The fill rate is the ratio of the amount of inventory used to the total inventory available:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Fill rate} = \\frac{\\text{Amount of inventory used}}{\\text{Total inventory available}} = \\frac{11000}{14100} \\approx 0.779\n   \\]\n   To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Fill rate} \\approx 0.779 \\times 100 = 77.9\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the fill rate the store achieves is \\boxed{77.9\\%}.",

Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand over two weeks:**\n   The weekly demand for shampoo is normally distributed with a mean of 2,800 and a standard deviation of 1,000. Therefore, the total demand over two weeks is also normally distributed with a mean of \\(2 \\times 2800 = 5600\\) and a standard deviation of \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times 1000 = 1414.21\\).\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory and the order quantity:**\n   The store starts with 8,500 units in inventory and orders 11,000 units. Therefore, the total inventory available after the order is \\(8500 + 11000 = 19500\\) units.\n\n3. **Calculate the probability that the total demand over two weeks is less than or equal to the total inventory available:**\n   We need to find the probability that a normally distributed random variable with a mean of 5600 and a standard deviation of 1414.21 is less than or equal to 19500.
