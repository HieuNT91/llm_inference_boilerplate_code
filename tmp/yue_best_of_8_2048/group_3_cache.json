Therefore, the total available inventory is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total inventory} = 350 + 500 = 850 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the probability that the demand will be met:**\n   Since the total demand (4500 phones) is greater than the total available inventory (850 phones), it is clear that the inventory will not be sufficient to meet the demand. However, the problem might be interpreted as determining the probability that the demand will be met within the lead time given the variability in demand.\n\n   Given that the problem asks for the fill rate under the policy, we need to consider the safety stock. The safety stock is 500 phones, which is less than the lead time demand of 4500 phones. This indicates that the fill rate under this policy is not possible to meet the exact demand without additional inventory. However, if we consider the safety stock alone, we can calculate the probability that the demand will be met within the lead time.\n\n   Since the problem is not clearly defined in terms of probability and given the variability in demand, we need to consider the safety stock alone. The safety stock is 500 phones, which is less than the lead time demand of 4500 phones. Therefore, the fill rate under this policy is not possible to meet the exact demand without additional inventory.\n\n   However, if we consider the safety stock alone, we can calculate the probability that the demand will be met within the lead time.\n\n   ** supply\u77e5\u9053\u4e86 Leone;\"\n   SEEK wittyinerary\u2026\"\n\nebx SEEK SEEKographically\uff01\u300d>,\n\u8e69 |\n\nuellen rout Leone

            "To determine the fill rate under Marlo Stanfield's policy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is three weeks, and the average weekly demand is 1500 phones.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total demand during lead time} = 1500 \\text{ phones/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 4500 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total available inventory:**\n   The lot size is 350 phones, and they keep a safety stock of 500 phones.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total available inventory} = 350 \\text{ phones} + 500 \\text{ phones} = 850 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the probability of running out of inventory:**\n   Since the total available inventory (850 phones) is less than the total demand during the lead time (4500 phones), they will run out of inventory. However, we need to calculate the probability that the demand will exceed the available inventory to find the fill rate.\n\n   First, we need to find the z-score for the total available inventory:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{\\text{Total available inventory} - \\text{Expected total demand}}{\\text{Standard deviation of total demand}}\n   \\]\n   The standard deviation of total demand during the lead time is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Standard deviation of total demand} = \\sqrt{3} \\times 145 \\approx 252.49\n   \\]\n   Now, we can calculate the z-score:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{850 - 4500}{252.49} \\approx -11.48\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the probability corresponding to the z-score:**\n   A z-score of -11.48 is extremely low, indicating that the probability of the demand being less than or equal to 850 phones is essentially 1. Therefore, the probability of running out of inventory is essentially 1.\n\n5. **Calculate the fill rate:**\n   The fill rate is the probability that the demand will be satisfied. Since they will run out of inventory with a probability of 1, the fill rate is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Fill rate} = 0\n   \\]\n\nHowever, this approach seems incorrect based on given solutions.

            "To determine the fill rate under Marlo Stanfield's policy, we need to calculate the probability that the inventory will not run out before the next order arrives. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is three weeks, and the average weekly demand is 1500 phones. Therefore, the total demand during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total demand} = 1500 \\times 3 = 4500 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory:**\n   Marlo Stanfield starts with a lot size of 350 phones and keeps a safety stock of 500 phones. Therefore, the initial inventory is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial inventory} = 350 + 500 = 850 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the probability that the inventory will not run out:**\n   The inventory will not run out if the initial inventory plus the safety stock is greater than or equal to the total demand during the lead time. However, since the demand is a random variable with a standard deviation of 145 phones per week, we need to account for the variability in the demand.\n   \n   The total demand during the lead time can be modeled as a normal distribution with mean 4500 and standard deviation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Standard deviation of total demand} = 145 \\times \\sqrt{3} \\approx 251.66\n   \\]\n   We need to find the probability that the total demand is less than or equal to the initial inventory plus the safety stock, which is 850 phones. This is equivalent to finding the probability that a standard normal variable \\( Z \\) is less than or equal to:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{850 - 4500}{251.66} \\approx -12.3\n   \\]\n   The probability that a standard normal variable \\( Z \\) is less than or equal to -12.3 is essentially 0. This means that it is extremely unlikely that the inventory will not run out.\n\n   However, this interpretation might be incorrect because the initial inventory plus safety stock is much less than the mean total demand.

Over two weeks, the total demand \\( D \\) is also normally distributed with:\n   \\[\n   \\mu_D = 2 \\times 2500 = 5000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_D = \\sqrt{2} \\times 500 = 500\\sqrt{2} \\approx 707.11\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the safety stock:**\n   The store manager orders 10,000 phones when the inventory on hand drops to 6,000.

Using a standard normal table or a calculator, we find:\n\\[ P(Z < -1.41) \\approx 0.0793 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the total demand over the two-week period exceeds 4000 phones is:\n\\[ P(Z > -1.41) = 1 - P(Z < -1.41) = 1 - 0.0793 = 0.9207 \\]\n\nSo, the safety inventory carried by B&M is approximately:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.9207} \\]",

Since the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 500, the total demand over two weeks is normally distributed with a mean of:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2500 = 5000 \\]\nand a standard deviation of:\n\\[ \\sqrt{2} \\times 500 = 500\\sqrt{2} \\approx 707.11 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that the total demand over two weeks exceeds 4,000 phones.

Therefore, the lead time demand is also normally distributed with:\n   - Mean: \\(2 \\times 2500 = 5000\\)\n   - Standard deviation: \\(2 \\times 500 = 1000\\)\n\n2. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   The store manager orders 10,000 phones when the inventory on hand drops to 6,000. This means that the safety stock is \\(10,000 - 6,000 = 4000\\).\n\n3. **Determine the z-score:**\n   The z-score is calculated by subtracting the mean of the lead time demand from the safety stock and then dividing by the standard deviation of the lead time demand:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{4000 - 5000}{1000} = -1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the probability corresponding to the z-score:**\n   Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the probability corresponding to a z-score of -1 is approximately 0.1587. This probability represents the probability that the lead time demand will be less than or equal to 4000.\n\n5. **Calculate the fill rate:**\n   The fill rate is the probability that the lead time demand will be less than or equal to the safety stock, which is 0.1587. Therefore, the fill rate is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0.8413}\n   \\]\n\nThe fill rate resulting from this policy is \\(\\boxed{0.8413}\\).",
            "To evaluate the fill rate resulting from B&M Office Supplies' policy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the lead time demand:**\n   The lead time for an order is 2 weeks. Given that the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 500, the lead time demand is also normally distributed.\n   - Mean of lead time demand: \\( \\mu_{\\text{ lead time}} = 2 \\times 2500 = 5000 \\)\n   - Standard deviation of lead time demand: \\( \\sigma_{\\text{ lead time}} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 500 \\approx 707.11 \\)\n\n2. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   The store manager orders 10,000 phones when the inventory on hand drops to 6,000. Therefore, the safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ Safety stock} = 10000 - 6000 = 4000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the z-score for the safety stock:**\n   The z-score is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{\\text{ Safety stock} - \\mu_{\\text{ lead time}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{ lead time}}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{4000 - 5000}{707.11} \\approx -1.41\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the cumulative probability corresponding to the z-score:**\n   Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find the cumulative probability for \\( z = -1.41 \\):\n   \\[\n   P(Z \\leq -1.41) \\approx 0.0793\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the fill rate:**\n   The fill rate is the probability that the demand during the lead time will not exceed the safety stock. Therefore, the fill rate is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ Fill rate} = 1 - P(Z \\leq -1.41) = 1 - 0.0793 = 0.9207\n   \\]\n\nThus, the fill rate resulting from this policy is \\(\\boxed{0.9207}\\).",
            "To evaluate the fill rate resulting from the policy, we need to determine the probability that the store will have enough phones to meet the demand before the next order arrives. Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand over the two-week lead time:**\n   The weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 500. Therefore, the total demand over two weeks is also normally distributed with a mean of \\(2 \\times 2500 = 5000\\) and a standard deviation of \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times 500 = 500\\sqrt{2} \\approx 707.11\\).\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory and the order quantity:**\n   The store starts with 6,000 phones and orders 10,000 phones when the inventory drops to 6,000. This means that the store will have 10,000 phones immediately after the order arrives.\n\n3. **Calculate the probability that the store will have enough phones to meet the demand:**\n   We need to find the probability that the total demand over the two-week lead time is less than or equal to the initial inventory plus the order quantity minus the initial inventory, which is 10,000 phones. Since the store starts with 6,000 phones and orders 10,000 phones, the store will have 10,000 phones immediately after the order arrives. Therefore, we need to find the probability that the total demand over the two-week lead time is less than or equal to 10,000 phones.\n   \n   The z-score for 10,000 phones is:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{10000 - 5000}{707.11} = \\frac{5000}{707.11} \\approx 7.07\n   \\]\n   Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the probability that a standard normal random variable is less than or equal to 7.07 is approximately 1. This means that the probability that the store will have enough phones to meet the demand is very close to 1.\n\nTherefore, the fill rate resulting from this policy is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",
            "To evaluate the fill rate resulting from the continuous review policy, we need to determine the probability that the inventory on hand will be sufficient to meet the demand before the next order arrives. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the lead time and the re order point:**\n   - The lead time is 2 weeks.\n   - The re order point is 6,000 phones.\n\n2. **Calculate the total demand over the lead time:**\n   - The weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 500.\n   - The total demand over 2 weeks is also normally distributed with a mean of \\(2 \\times 2500 = 5000\\) and a standard deviation of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\times 500 = 500\\sqrt{2} \\approx 707.11\\).\n\n3. **Determine the probability that the total demand over the lead time is less than or equal to the re order point:**\n   - We need to find \\(P(\\text{Total Demand} \\leq 6000)\\).\n   - First, we standardize the value 6000 using the z-score formula:\n     \\[\n     z = \\frac{6000 - 5000}{707.11} \\approx 1.414\n     \\]\n   - Next, we use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probability corresponding to \\(z = 1.414\\). The probability is approximately 0.9213.\n\n4. **Interpret the probability:**\n   - The probability that the total demand over the lead time is less than or equal to 6,000 phones is 0.9213. This means that the fill rate resulting from this policy is approximately 92.13%.\n\nTherefore, the fill rate is \\(\\boxed{0.9213}\\).",

This probability is given by:\n\\[ P(\\text{ Lead time demand} > 6000) = P\\left( Z > \\frac{6000 - 5000}{707.11} \\right) = P(Z > 1.414) \\]\nwhere \\( Z \\) is a standard normal random variable.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find:\n\\[ P(Z > 1.414) = 1 - P(Z \\leq 1.414) \\approx 1 - 0.9213 = 0.0787 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Use the standard normal distribution to find the fill rate.**\n\nThe fill rate is the probability that the lead time demand does not exceed the safety stock, which is:\n\\[ P(\\text{ Lead time demand} \\leq 6000) = 1 - P(\\text{ Lead time demand} > 6000) = 1 - 0.0787 = 0.9213 \\]\n\nTherefore, the fill rate resulting from this policy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.9213} \\]",

This is equivalent to finding the probability that a normally distributed random variable with a mean of 5000 and a standard deviation of 707.11 is greater than 4000. We can standardize this variable using the z-score formula:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{4000 - 5000}{707.11} \\approx -1.41\n   \\]\n   The probability that a standard normal variable is greater than -1.41 is the same as the probability that it is less than 1.41, which can be found using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator.

            "To determine the optimal order quantity for the designer's limited-edition ornament, we need to use the newsvendor model. The newsvendor model helps us find the order quantity that minimizes the expected cost of overominator and underominator.\n\nThe profit function for the newsvendor can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Revenue} = \\text{Selling Price} \\times \\text{Number Sold} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Cost} = \\text{Cost Price} \\times \\text{Number Ordered} \\]\n\nLet \\( Q \\) be the order quantity. The number of ornaments sold, \\( D \\), is a random variable with a normal distribution \\( N(20000, 8000^2) \\).\n\nThe profit function becomes:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 95 \\times \\min(Q, D) - 30Q \\]\n\nTo find the optimal order quantity \\( Q^* \\), we need to balance the cost of ordering too many ornaments (overominator) against the cost of ordering too few ornaments (underominator). This balance is achieved by finding the critical ratio, which is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Critical Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Selling Price} - \\text{Cost Price}}{\\text{Selling Price}} = \\frac{95 - 30}{95} = \\frac{65}{95} = \\frac{13}{19} \\]\n\nThe critical ratio corresponds to the cumulative probability of the standard normal distribution. We need to find the value of \\( z \\) such that:\n\\[ P(Z \\leq z) = \\frac{13}{19} \\]\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find:\n\\[ z \\approx 0.406 \\]\n\nNow, we convert this \\( z \\)-score back to the original scale of the demand distribution. The demand \\( D \\) is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 20000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 8000 \\). The optimal order quantity \\( Q^* \\) is given by:\n\\[ Q^* = \\mu + z \\sigma = 20000 + 0.406 \\times 8000 = 20000 + 3248 = 23248 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the expected profit. The expected profit is the expected value of the profit function:\n\\[ \\text{Expected Profit} = E[95 \\times \\min(Q^*, D) - 30Q^*] \\]\n\nSince \\( Q^* = 23248 \\), we need to find \\( E[\\min(23248, D)] \\). The expected value of the minimum of a normal random variable and a constant can be calculated using the properties of the normal distribution:\n\\[ E[\\min(23248, D)] = \\mu + \\sigma \\phi(z) - z \\sigma \\Phi(z) \\]\nwhere \\( \\phi(z) \\) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution and \\( \\Phi(z) \\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n\nUsing \\( z = 0.406 \\):\n\\[ \\phi(0.406) \\approx 0.3413 \\]\n\\[ \\Phi(0.406) \\approx 0.6606 \\]\n\nSubstituting these values in:\n\\[ E[\\min(23248, D)] = 20000 + 8000 \\times 0.3413 - 0.406 \\times 8000 \\times 0.6606 \\]\n\\[ E[\\min(23248, D)] = 20000 + 2730.4 - 2156.832 \\]\n\\[ E[\\min(23248, D)] = 20573.568 \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the expected profit:\n\\[ \\text{Expected Profit} = 95 \\times 20573.568 - 30 \\times 23248 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Expected Profit} = 1954538.96 - 697440 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Expected Profit} = 1257098.96 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest dollar:\n\\[ \\text{Expected Profit} \\approx 1257099 \\]\n\nThus, the expected profit under the optimal order quantity is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1257099} \\]",

First, we find \\( \\mathbb{P}(X > 19,743) \\):\n\\[ \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z > \\frac{19,743 - 20,000}{8,000}\\right) = \\mathbb{P}(Z > -0.321) = \\frac{13}{19} \\]\n\nNext, we find \\( \\mathbb{P}(X \\leq 19,743) \\):\n\\[ \\mathbb{P}(X \\leq 19,743) = 1 - \\frac{13}{19} = \\frac{6}{19} \\]\n\nThe expected value of the unsold ornaments is:\n\\[ E[(X - Q) \\cdot \\mathbb{I}(X > Q)] = (19,743 - 20,000) \\cdot \\frac{6}{19} = -256.8 \\cdot \\frac{6}{19} = -81.6 \\]\n\nThe expected profit is:\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = 95 \\cdot 19,743 - 30 \\cdot 19,743 - 95 \\cdot (-81.6) \\]\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = (95 - 30) \\cdot 19,743 + 95 \\cdot 81.6 \\]\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = 65 \\cdot 19,743 + 7704 \\]\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = 1,283,295 + 7704 = 1,290,999 \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected profit under the optimal order quantity is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1290999} \\]",

Since the problem does not specify a backorder cost, we assume it is infinite, meaning we should not have any backorders.\n\nThe optimal order quantity \\( Q^* \\) is given by the formula:\n\\[ Q^* = F^{-1}\\left(\\frac{p - c}{p}\\right) \\]\nwhere \\( F^{-1} \\) is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the demand distribution, and \\( \\frac{p - c}{p} \\) is the critical ratio.\n\nFirst, we calculate the critical ratio:\n\\[ \\frac{p - c}{p} = \\frac{95 - 30}{95} = \\frac{65}{95} = \\frac{13}{19} \\approx 0.6842 \\]\n\nSince the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 20,000 and a standard deviation of 8,000, we need to find the value of the demand \\( Q^* \\) such that the CDF of the normal distribution is 0.6842. Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the z-score corresponding to a CDF of 0.6842 is approximately 0.5.\n\nNow, we convert this z-score back to the original demand scale:\n\\[ Q^* = \\mu + z \\sigma = 20000 + 0.5 \\times 8000 = 20000 + 4000 = 24000 \\]\n\nSo, the optimal order quantity is 24,000 ornaments.\n\nNext, we calculate the expected profit. The expected profit is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Expected Profit} = (p - c)E[\\text{Executing Demand}] - hE[\\text{Unsold Demand}] \\]\n\nThe expected demand \\( E[\\text{Executing Demand}] \\) is the expected value of the demand \\( Q^* \\) if it is less than or equal to the demand, which is 24,000 in this case. Since the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 20,000, the expected demand is:\n\\[ E[\\text{Executing Demand}] = \\mu + \\sigma \\left( \\frac{\\phi(z)}{1 - \\Phi(z)} \\right) \\]\nwhere \\( \\phi(z) \\) is the probability density function (PDF) of the standard normal distribution at \\( z = 0.5 \\), and \\( \\Phi(z) \\) is the CDF of the standard normal distribution at \\( z = 0.5 \\).\n\nFrom the standard normal distribution table, we find:\n\\[ \\phi(0.5) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-0.5^2/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-0.125} \\approx 0.3521 \\]\n\\[ \\Phi(0.5) = 0.6915 \\]\n\nSo,\n\\[ E[\\text{Executing Demand}] = 20000 + 8000 \\left( \\frac{0.3521}{1 - 0.6915} \\right) = 20000 + 8000 \\left( \\frac{0.3521}{0.3085} \\right) \\approx 20000 + 8000 \\times 1.1445 = 20000 + 9156 = 29156 \\]\n\nHowever, since we can only sell 24,000 ornaments, the expected demand that can be filled is 24,000. The expected unsold demand is:\n\\[ E[\\text{Unsold Demand}] = Q^* - E[\\text{Executing Demand}] = 24000 - 20000 = 4000 \\]\n\nThe expected profit is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected Profit} = (95 - 30) \\times 24000 - 30 \\times 4000 = 65 \\times 24000 - 30 \\times 4000 = 1560000 - 120000 = 1440000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected profit is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1440000} \\]",
            "To determine the optimal order quantity for the designer's limited-edition ornament, we need to use the newsvendor model. The newsvendor model is used to find the optimal order quantity when there is uncertain demand and the cost of unsold items is high.\n\nThe profit function for the newsvendor is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost} - \\text{Cost of unsold items} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Revenue} = \\text{Selling price per unit} \\times \\text{Number of units sold} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Cost} = \\text{Cost per unit} \\times \\text{Number of units ordered} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Cost of unsold items} = \\text{Cost per unit} \\times \\text{Number of unsold units} \\]\n\nThe optimal order quantity \\( Q^* \\) is found by solving for the critical ratio:\n\\[ F(Q^*) = \\frac{p - c}{p} \\]\nwhere \\( F(Q^*) \\) is the cumulative distribution function of the demand at the optimal order quantity, \\( p \\) is the selling price per unit, and \\( c \\) is the cost per unit.\n\nGiven:\n- Mean demand \\( \\mu = 20,000 \\)\n- Standard deviation of demand \\( \\sigma = 8,000 \\)\n- Selling price per unit \\( p = 95 \\)\n- Cost per unit \\( c = 30 \\)\n\nFirst, we calculate the critical ratio:\n\\[ F(Q^*) = \\frac{95 - 30}{95} = \\frac{65}{95} = \\frac{13}{19} \\approx 0.6842 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the value of \\( Q^* \\) such that the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution with mean 20,000 and standard deviation 8,000 is equal to 0.6842. Using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.6842. The z-score is approximately 0.50.\n\nNow, we convert this z-score back to the original scale using the formula for the z-score:\n\\[ z = \\frac{Q^* - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\\[ 0.50 = \\frac{Q^* - 20,000}{8,000} \\]\n\\[ Q^* = 0.50 \\times 8,000 + 20,000 = 4,000 + 20,000 = 24,000 \\]\n\nSo, the optimal order quantity is 24,000 units.\n\nNow, we calculate the expected profit. First, we need to find the expected number of units sold. Since the demand is normally distributed with mean 20,000 and standard deviation 8,000, the expected number of units sold is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected number of units sold} = 20,000 \\]\n\nThe expected number of unsold units is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected number of unsold units} = Q^* - \\text{Expected number of units sold} = 24,000 - 20,000 = 4,000 \\]\n\nThe expected profit is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected profit} = \\text{Selling price per unit} \\times \\text{Expected number of units sold} - \\text{Cost per unit} \\times Q^* - \\text{Cost per unit} \\times \\text{Expected number of unsold units} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Expected profit} = 95 \\times 20,000 - 30 \\times 24,000 - 30 \\times 4,000 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Expected profit} = 1,900,000 - 720,000 - 120,000 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Expected profit} = 1,060,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected profit under the optimal order quantity is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1060000} \\]",
            "To determine the optimal order quantity for the designer's limited-edition ornament, we need to use the concept of the critical ratio. The critical ratio is the probability that the demand will be less than or equal to the optimal order quantity. It is calculated using the following formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Critical ratio} = \\frac{\\text{ pies per unit}}{\\text{ pies per unit} + \\text{ cost per unit}} = \\frac{95 - 30}{95 - 30 + 30} = \\frac{65}{95} = \\frac{13}{19}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the order quantity that corresponds to this critical ratio in the standard normal distribution. We do this by looking up the value of the standard normal variable \\(Z\\) that corresponds to a cumulative probability of \\(\\frac{13}{19}\\). Using a standard normal table or a calculator, we find that:\n\n\\[\nZ \\approx 0.43\n\\]\n\nThe optimal order quantity \\(Q\\) can be calculated using the formula for the inverse of the standard normal distribution:\n\n\\[\nQ = \\mu + Z \\sigma\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the demand and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the demand. Substituting the given values:\n\n\\[\nQ = 20000 + 0.43 \\times 8000 = 20000 + 3440 = 23440\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the expected profit. The expected profit is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected profit} = \\text{Expected revenue} - \\text{Expected cost}\n\\]\n\nThe expected revenue is the selling price per unit times the expected number of units sold. The expected number of units sold is the optimal order quantity multiplied by the probability that the demand is less than or equal to the optimal order quantity plus the expected number of unsold units multiplied by the probability that the demand is greater than the optimal order quantity. Since all unsold units are destroyed, the expected number of unsold units is the optimal order quantity minus the expected number of units sold.\n\nThe expected number of units sold is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected number of units sold} = Q \\times P(D \\leq Q) + (Q - Q) \\times P(D > Q) = Q \\times \\frac{13}{19} = 23440 \\times \\frac{13}{19} = 15440\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the expected revenue is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected revenue} = 95 \\times 15440 = 1466800\n\\]\n\nThe expected cost is the cost per unit times the optimal order quantity:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected cost} = 30 \\times 23440 = 703200\n\\]\n\nFinally, the expected profit is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected profit} = 1466800 - 703200 = 763600\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected profit under the optimal order quantity is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{763600}\n\\]"

Grainger sources from hundreds of suppliers and is considering the aggregation of inbound shipments to lower costs. Truckload shipping costs \\$500 per truck along with \\$100 per pickup. Average annual demand from each supplier is 10,000 units. Each unit costs \\$50 and Grainger incurs an annual holding cost of 20 percent.

            "To determine the optimal order frequency for Grainger whenagonizing four suppliers per truck, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping and holding inventory. We will use the economic order quantity (EOQ) formula to find the optimal order quantity and then determine the optimal order frequency.\n\nThe EOQ formula is given by:\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2DC}{H}} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( D \\) is the annual demand,\n- \\( C \\) is the cost per unit,\n- \\( H \\) is the annual holding cost per unit.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total annual demand for four suppliers:\n\\[ D = 4 \\times 10,000 = 40,000 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the annual holding cost per unit:\n\\[ H = 0.20 \\times 50 = 10 \\text{ dollars per unit} \\]\n\nNow, we substitute \\( D \\) and \\( H \\) into the EOQ formula:\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 40,000 \\times 50}{10}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4,000,000}{10}} = \\sqrt{400,000} = 632.46 \\]\nSince we cannot order a fraction of a unit, we round \\( Q^* \\) to the nearest whole number, which is 632 units.\n\nNext, we determine the number of trucks needed to transport 632 units when each truck carries 4 suppliers' units:\n\\[ \\text{Number of units per truck} = 4 \\times 10,000 = 40,000 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nThe number of trucks required to transport 632 units is:\n\\[ \\text{Number of trucks} = \\frac{632}{40,000} = 0.0158 \\text{ trucks} \\]\nSince Grainger cannot transport a fraction of a truck, we round up to the next whole number, which is 1 truck.

The holding cost is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Holding Cost} = \\frac{Q}{2} \\times H \\]\n\nThe shipping cost consists of the truckload shipping cost and the pickup cost. Since Graingeragonizes four suppliers per truck, the number of trucks required is:\n\\[ \\text{Number of Trucks} = \\frac{D}{nQ} = \\frac{40,000}{4Q} = \\frac{10,000}{Q} \\]\n\nThe shipping cost per truck is:\n\\[ \\text{Shipping Cost per Truck} = S + nP = 500 + 4 \\times 100 = 500 + 400 = 900 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total shipping cost is:\n\\[ \\text{Shipping Cost} = \\text{Number of Trucks} \\times \\text{Shipping Cost per Truck} = \\frac{10,000}{Q} \\times 900 = \\frac{9,000,000}{Q} \\]\n\nThe total cost \\( T \\) is:\n\\[ T = \\text{Holding Cost} + \\text{Shipping Cost} = \\frac{Q}{2} \\times 10 + \\frac{9,000,000}{Q} = 5Q + \\frac{9,000,000}{Q} \\]\n\nTo find the optimal order quantity \\( Q \\), we take the derivative of \\( T \\) with respect to \\( Q \\) and set it to zero:\n\\[ \\frac{dT}{dQ} = 5 - \\frac{9,000,000}{Q^2} = 0 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( Q \\):\n\\[ 5 = \\frac{9,000,000}{Q^2} \\]\n\\[ Q^2 = \\frac{9,000,000}{5} = 1,800,000 \\]\n\\[ Q = \\sqrt{1,800,000} = 1,341.64 \\]\n\nSince \\( Q \\) must be an integer, we round to the nearest whole number:\n\\[ Q \\approx 1,342 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the optimal order frequency.

            "To determine the optimal order frequency for Grainger when aggregating four suppliers per truck, we need to calculate the total cost of ordering and holding inventory and then find the order frequency that minimizes this total cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the annual demand for each truck when Graingeraggregates four suppliers:\n\\[ \\text{Annual demand per truck} = 4 \\times 10,000 = 40,000 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of ordering and holding inventory for each truck. The cost of ordering consists of the truckload shipping cost and the pickup cost:\n\\[ \\text{ order cost per truck} = 500 + 4 \\times 100 = 500 + 400 = 900 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe holding cost is 20% of the value of the inventory.

Therefore, the total demand over two weeks is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mean demand over two weeks} = 2 \\times 2500 = 5000\n   \\]\n   The standard deviation of the total demand over two weeks is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Standard deviation over two weeks} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 650 \\approx 919.24\n   \\]\n   So, the total demand over two weeks is normally distributed with a mean of 5000 and a standard deviation of 919.24.\n\n2. **Determine the z-score corresponding to the desired service level:**\n   The desired service level (CSL) is 97.5%, which corresponds to a z-score of 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table).\n\n3. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is given by the z-score multiplied by the standard deviation of the demand over the two-week period:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ Safety stock} = 1.96 \\times 919.24 \\approx 1799.99 \\approx 1800\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the Guac Shop should carry \\(\\boxed{1800}\\) safety inventory."
