            "To evaluate the expected overstock as a result of the manager ordering 450 pairs of skis, we need to determine the expected number of skis that will be sold and then subtract this from the number of skis ordered.\n\nFirst, let's denote the demand for skis by the random variable \\( D \\). The demand \\( D \\) is normally distributed with a mean \\( \\mu = 350 \\) and a standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 100 \\). The manager has ordered 450 pairs of skis, so we need to find the expected overstock, which is given by \\( E[450 - D] \\).\n\nThe expected value of a constant minus a random variable is the constant minus the expected value of the random variable. Therefore, we have:\n\\[\nE[450 - D] = 450 - E[D]\n\\]\nSince the expected value of the demand \\( D \\) is \\( \\mu = 350 \\), we substitute this value into the equation:\n\\[\nE[450 - D] = 450 - 350 = 100\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected overstock as a result of ordering 450 pairs of skis is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
            "To determine the expected overstock of skis at Sportmart, we need to calculate the probability that the demand for skis will exceed 450 pairs and then use this probability to find the expected overstock.\n\nFirst, we standardize the demand variable \\( D \\) using the formula for the z-score:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{D - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\mu = 350 \\) and \\( \\sigma = 100 \\). We want to find the probability that \\( D > 450 \\). Substituting \\( D = 450 \\) into the z-score formula, we get:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{450 - 350}{100} = 1\n\\]\nNext, we use the standard normal distribution table to find the probability that \\( Z > 1 \\). From the table, we find that the probability that \\( Z \\leq 1 \\) is approximately 0.8413. Therefore, the probability that \\( Z > 1 \\) is:\n\\[\nP(Z > 1) = 1 - P(Z \\leq 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587\n\\]\nThis means that the probability that the demand for skis will exceed 450 pairs is 0.1587.\n\nThe expected overstock is the expected value of the excess demand, which is the demand minus the order quantity, but only when the demand exceeds the order quantity. The expected value of the excess demand can be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Expected overstock} = (D - 450) \\cdot P(D > 450)\n\\]\nSince \\( D \\) is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 350 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 100 \\), the expected value of \\( D \\) is 350. However, we need the expected value of the excess demand, which is the expected value of \\( D \\) minus 450, but only when \\( D > 450 \\). This can be found using the formula for the expected value of a truncated normal distribution. For a normal distribution with mean \\( \\mu \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\), the expected value of the truncated normal distribution above \\( a \\) is:\n\\[\nE(D \\mid D > a) = \\mu + \\sigma \\frac{\\phi(z)}{P(Z > z)}\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\phi(z) \\) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution at \\( z \\). For \\( z = 1 \\), we have:\n\\[\n\\phi(1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1^2}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\approx 0.3989\n\\]\nTherefore, the expected value of \\( D \\) given that \\( D > 450 \\) is:\n\\[\nE(D \\mid D > 450) = 350 + 100 \\cdot \\frac{0.3989}{0.1587} = 350 + 100 \\cdot 2.5 = 350 + 250 = 600\n\\]\nThe expected overstock is then:\n\\[\n\\text{Expected overstock} = E(D \\mid D > 450) - 450 = 600 - 450 = 150\n\\]\nThus, the expected overstock as a result of ordering 450 pairs of skis is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{150}\n\\]",
            "To determine the expected overstock of skis at Sportmart, we need to calculate the probability that the demand for skis will exceed the number of pairs ordered, and then use this probability to find the expected overstock.\n\nFirst, let's define the random variable \\( D \\) as the demand for skis. According to the problem, \\( D \\) follows a normal distribution with a mean \\( \\mu = 350 \\) and a standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 100 \\). We are interested in the probability that the demand exceeds 450 pairs of skis, i.e., \\( P(D > 450) \\).\n\nTo find this probability, we first standardize the value 450 using the z-score formula:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{D - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{450 - 350}{100} = 1\n\\]\nSo, we need to find \\( P(Z > 1) \\), where \\( Z \\) is a standard normal random variable. Using standard normal distribution tables or a calculator, we find that:\n\\[\nP(Z > 1) = 1 - P(Z \\leq 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587\n\\]\nThis means that the probability that the demand exceeds 450 pairs of skis is 0.1587.\n\nNext, we calculate the expected overstock. The overstock is the difference between the number of pairs ordered and the demand, but only if the demand exceeds the number of pairs ordered. The expected overstock \\( E(\\text{overstock}) \\) is given by:\n\\[\nE(\\text{overstock}) = (450 - D) \\cdot P(D > 450)\n\\]\nSince \\( P(D > 450) = 0.1587 \\), we have:\n\\[\nE(\\text{overstock}) = (450 - D) \\cdot 0.1587\n\\]\nTo find the expected value of \\( 450 - D \\), we use the linearity of expectation:\n\\[\nE(450 - D) = 450 - E(D)\n\\]\nSince the mean of \\( D \\) is 350, we have:\n\\[\nE(450 - D) = 450 - 350 = 100\n\\]\nTherefore, the expected overstock is:\n\\[\nE(\\text{overstock}) = 100 \\cdot 0.1587 = 15.87\n\\]\nRounding to two decimal places, the expected overstock is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15.87}\n\\]",

The demand for skis is normally distributed with a mean \\(\\mu = 350\\) and a standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 100\\). The manager has ordered 450 pairs of skis.\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability that the demand \\(D\\) is less than or equal to 450. This is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution evaluated at 450. The CDF of a normal random variable \\(D\\) with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is denoted by \\(P(D \\leq x)\\) and can be expressed as:\n\\[ P(D \\leq 450) = P\\left(\\frac{D - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\leq \\frac{450 - 350}{100}\\right) = P(Z \\leq 1) \\]\nwhere \\(Z\\) is a standard normal random variable. From standard normal distribution tables, we find that:\n\\[ P(Z \\leq 1) = 0.8413 \\]\n\nThis means that the probability that the demand is less than or equal to 450 is 0.8413. Therefore, the probability that the demand is greater than 450 is:\n\\[ P(D > 450) = 1 - P(D \\leq 450) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 \\]\n\nThe expected number of skis sold is the mean of the demand, which is 350. However, since the manager ordered 450 skis, the expected overstock is the expected number of skis ordered minus the expected number of skis sold. The expected number of skis sold is the mean of the demand, but we need to consider the probability that the demand exceeds 450. The expected number of skis sold is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected number of skis sold} = \\mu + \\sigma \\cdot \\phi\\left(\\frac{450 - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) \\]\nwhere \\(\\phi(z)\\) is the probability density function (PDF) of the standard normal distribution. The PDF of the standard normal distribution at \\(z = 1\\) is:\n\\[ \\phi(1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1^2}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\approx 0.3989 \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected number of skis sold is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected number of skis sold} = 350 + 100 \\cdot 0.3989 = 350 + 39.89 = 389.89 \\]\n\nThe expected overstock is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected overstock} = 450 - 389.89 = 60.11 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the expected overstock is:\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]",

The manager has ordered 450 pairs of skis.\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability that the demand is less than or equal to 450 pairs of skis. This is done by standardizing the value 450 using the z-score formula:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{450 - 350}{100} = 1\n\\]\nNext, we use the standard normal distribution table to find the probability that a standard normal random variable is less than or equal to 1. From the table, we find that:\n\\[\nP(Z \\leq 1) \\approx 0.8413\n\\]\nThis means that the probability that the demand is less than or equal to 450 pairs of skis is 0.8413. The expected number of skis sold is the mean demand multiplied by the probability that the demand is less than or equal to 450 pairs of skis:\n\\[\n\\text{Expected number of skis sold} = \\mu \\cdot P(Z \\leq 1) = 350 \\cdot 0.8413 = 294.455\n\\]\nThe expected overstock is the number of skis ordered minus the expected number of skis sold:\n\\[\n\\text{Expected overstock} = 450 - 294.455 = 155.545\n\\]\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the expected overstock is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{156}\n\\]",

However, since we are dealing with a continuous distribution and we are interested in the expected value of the minimum of the demand and the order quantity, we use the following formula:\n   \\[\n   E[\\min(Q, D)] = \\mu + \\sigma \\left( z \\cdot \\phi(z) + \\Phi(z) \\cdot \\text{sign}(Q - \\mu) \\right)\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\phi(z)\\) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution at \\(z\\), and \\(\\Phi(z)\\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution at \\(z\\).\n\n   The probability density function \\(\\phi(z)\\) at \\(z = 1\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\phi(1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1^2}{2}} \\approx 0.3989\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\(Q = 450\\) and \\(\\mu = 350\\), \\(Q > \\mu\\), so \\(\\text{sign}(Q - \\mu) = 1\\).\n   \\[\n   E[\\min(Q, D)] = 350 + 100 \\left( 1 \\cdot 0.3989 + 0.8413 \\cdot 1 \\right) = 350 + 100 \\cdot 1.2402 = 350 + 124.02 = 474.02\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the expected overstock:**\n   The expected overstock is the order quantity minus the expected number of skis sold.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected overstock} = Q - E[\\min(Q, D)] = 450 - 474.02 = -24.02\n   \\]\n   Since a negative overstock indicates a shortage, it means the expected overstock should be positive if we have ordered more than the expected demand.

            "To determine the expected overstock of skis at Sportmart, we need to calculate the probability that the demand for skis will exceed the number of skis ordered and then use this probability to find the expected overstock.\n\nFirst, let's define the random variable \\( D \\) as the demand for skis. According to the problem, \\( D \\) follows a normal distribution with a mean \\( \\mu = 350 \\) and a standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 100 \\). We are interested in finding the probability that the demand exceeds 450 pairs of skis, i.e., \\( P(D > 450) \\).\n\nTo find this probability, we first standardize the normal random variable \\( D \\) by converting it to a standard normal random variable \\( Z \\). The standard normal random variable \\( Z \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{D - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{450 - 350}{100} = \\frac{100}{100} = 1 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that \\( Z \\) is greater than 1. This can be found using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator. The standard normal distribution table gives us the probability that \\( Z \\) is less than or equal to a certain value. Therefore, we need to find \\( P(Z \\leq 1) \\) and then subtract it from 1 to get \\( P(Z > 1) \\).\n\nFrom the standard normal distribution table, we find that \\( P(Z \\leq 1) \\approx 0.8413 \\). Therefore:\n\n\\[ P(Z > 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 \\]\n\nThis means that the probability that the demand for skis will exceed 450 pairs is 0.1587. The expected overstock is the product of this probability and the number of skis ordered. Thus, the expected overstock is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Expected overstock} = 0.1587 \\times 450 = 71.415 \\]\n\nSince the number of skis must be a whole number, we round 71.415 to the nearest whole number, which is 71.\n\nTherefore, the expected overstock as a result of ordering 450 pairs of skis is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{71} \\]",
            "To determine the expected overstock of skis, we need to find the expected number of skis sold and subtract it from the number of skis ordered. The number of skis sold follows a normal distribution with a mean of 350 and a standard deviation of 100. The manager has ordered 450 pairs of skis.\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability that the demand for skis is less than or equal to 450. This probability is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution evaluated at 450. The CDF of a normal distribution \\( N(\\mu, \\sigma^2) \\) is denoted by \\( \\Phi \\left( \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) \\).\n\nHere, \\( x = 450 \\), \\( \\mu = 350 \\), and \\( \\sigma = 100 \\). So, we need to find \\( \\Phi \\left( \\frac{450 - 350}{100} \\right) = \\Phi(1) \\).\n\nUsing standard normal distribution tables or a calculator, we find that \\( \\Phi(1) \\approx 0.8413 \\). This means that the probability that the demand is less than or equal to 450 is 0.8413. Therefore, the probability that the demand is greater than 450 is \\( 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 \\).\n\nThe expected number of skis sold is the mean of the normal distribution, which is 350. However, since the manager has ordered 450 skis, we need to find the expected number of skis sold given that the demand is greater than 450 and then use this to calculate the expected overstock.\n\nThe expected number of skis sold given that the demand is greater than 450 is calculated as follows:\n\\[ E[\\text{sales} \\mid \\text{demand} > 450] = \\frac{\\int_{450}^{\\infty} x f(x) \\, dx}{P(\\text{demand} > 450)}, \\]\nwhere \\( f(x) \\) is the probability density function of the normal distribution. This integral can be simplified using the properties of the normal distribution. The expected value of a normal distribution \\( N(\\mu, \\sigma^2) \\) given that it is greater than some value \\( a \\) is:\n\\[ E[\\text{sales} \\mid \\text{demand} > a] = \\mu + \\sigma \\frac{\\phi\\left( \\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)}{1 - \\Phi\\left( \\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)}, \\]\nwhere \\( \\phi(x) \\) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution. For \\( a = 450 \\), \\( \\mu = 350 \\), and \\( \\sigma = 100 \\), we have:\n\\[ E[\\text{sales} \\mid \\text{demand} > 450] = 350 + 100 \\frac{\\phi(1)}{1 - \\Phi(1)} = 350 + 100 \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1^2}{2}}}{0.1587} = 350 + 100 \\frac{0.3989}{0.1587} = 350 + 100 \\cdot 2.5 = 350 + 250 = 600. \\]\nHowever, since the actual expected number of skis sold is 350, the expected overstock is simply the difference between the number of skis ordered and the expected number of skis sold:\n\\[ \\text{Expected overstock} = 450 - 350 = 100. \\]\n\nThus, the expected overstock as a result of this policy is \\(\\boxed{100}\\)."

From standard normal distribution tables, we find that the z-score for a 95% service level is approximately 1.645.\n\nThe ROP is calculated as the mean total demand over the lead time plus the z-score times the standard deviation of the total demand over the lead time:\n\\[\n\\text{ROP} = 2000 + 1.645 \\times 600\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{ROP} = 2000 + 987\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{ROP} = 2987\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the reorder point should be \\(\\boxed{2987}\\).",

The store sells 650 jackets each month, so the annual demand is:\n\n\\[ D = 650 \\times 12 = 7800 \\text{ jackets} \\]\n\nNext, we know the fixed cost of a replenishment order \\( C \\) is \u20ac60.

            "To determine the optimal price of DO to a manufacturer discount of $0.15 per unit, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the demand function and the revenue function for DO:**\n   The demand function for Vitaherb is given by:\n   \\[\n   Q = 300,000 - 60,000p\n   \\]\n   where \\( Q \\) is the quantity demanded and \\( p \\) is the price per bottle. The revenue function \\( R \\) is the product of the price per bottle and the quantity demanded:\n   \\[\n   R = pQ = p(300,000 - 60,000p) = 300,000p - 60,000p^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the cost function for DO:**\n   The cost to DO is the cost to the manufacturer minus the discount per unit. The manufacturer's cost per bottle is $3, and the discount is $0.15 per unit. Therefore, the cost per bottle to DO is:\n   \\[\n   C_D = 3 - 0.15 = 2.85\n   \\]\n   The total cost function \\( C \\) is the cost per bottle times the quantity demanded:\n   \\[\n   C = 2.85Q = 2.85(300,000 - 60,000p) = 855,000 - 171,000p\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the profit function for DO:**\n   The profit function \\( \\pi \\) is the revenue minus the cost:\n   \\[\n   \\pi = R - C = (300,000p - 60,000p^2) - (855,000 - 171,000p) = 471,000p - 60,000p^2 - 855,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the value of \\( p \\) that maximizes the profit function:**\n   To find the maximum profit, we take the derivative of the profit function with respect to \\( p \\) and set it equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\pi}{dp} = 471,000 - 120,000p = 0\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( p \\):\n   \\[\n   120,000p = 471,000 \\implies p = \\frac{471,000}{120,000} = 3.925\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the optimal price of DO to a manufacturer discount of $0.15 per unit is \\(\\boxed{3.93}\\).",
