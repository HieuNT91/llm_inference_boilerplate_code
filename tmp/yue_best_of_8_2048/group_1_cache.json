Each jacket costs the store \u20ac80 and the company has an annual holding cost of 30 percent. The fixed cost of a replenishment order (including transportation) is \u20ac60. The store currently places a replenishment order every month for 550 jackets. What is the annual ordering cost?\nassistant\n",

            "To determine the annual ordering cost for the Adidas retail store in Berlin, we need to consider both the fixed cost of each replenishment order and the holding cost of the inventory.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of replenishment orders the store places in a year. Since the store places a replenishment order every month, the number of orders per year is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ orders/year} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total fixed cost of the replenishment orders in a year. The fixed cost of each order is \u20ac60, so the total fixed cost is:\n\\[ 12 \\times 60 = 720 \\text{ euros} \\]\n\nNow, let's determine the average inventory level. The store sells 650 jackets each month and places a replenishment order of 550 jackets each month. Therefore, the average inventory level is:\n\\[ \\frac{550}{2} = 275 \\text{ jackets} \\]\n\nThe holding cost per jacket per year is 30% of the cost of each jacket. Since each jacket costs \u20ac80, the holding cost per jacket per year is:\n\\[ 0.30 \\times 80 = 24 \\text{ euros/jacket/year} \\]\n\nThe total holding cost for the year is the average inventory level multiplied by the holding cost per jacket per year:\n\\[ 275 \\times 24 = 6600 \\text{ euros} \\]\n\nFinally, the annual ordering cost is the sum of the total fixed cost of the replenishment orders and the total holding cost:\n\\[ 720 + 6600 = 7320 \\text{ euros} \\]\n\nThus, the annual ordering cost is:\n\\[ \\boxed{7320} \\]",
            "To determine the annual ordering cost, we need to calculate the cost of placing replenishment orders for the year. The store places a replenishment order every month for 550 jackets, and each order incurs a fixed cost of \u20ac60. Therefore, the number of orders placed in a year is 12.\n\nThe annual ordering cost is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Annual ordering cost} = \\text{Number of orders per year} \\times \\text{Fixed cost per order}\n\\]\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[\n\\text{Annual ordering cost} = 12 \\times 60 = 720\n\\]\n\nThus, the annual ordering cost is \\(\\boxed{720}\\).",
            "To determine the annual ordering cost for the Adidas retail store in Berlin, we need to calculate the cost of placing replenishment orders and the holding cost for the inventory. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of replenishment orders per year:**\n   The store places a replenishment order every month, so in a year, the number of orders is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ orders/year}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the cost of each replenishment order:**\n   Each replenishment order costs the store \u20ac60, so the total cost of placing replenishment orders in a year is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 60 = 720 \\text{ euros}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the average inventory:**\n   The store sells 650 jackets each month and currently places a replenishment order for 550 jackets each month. Therefore, the average inventory is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{550}{2} = 275 \\text{ jackets}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the annual holding cost:**\n   The annual holding cost is 30% of the total value of the average inventory. The total value of the average inventory is:\n   \\[\n   275 \\times 80 = 22000 \\text{ euros}\n   \\]\n   So, the annual holding cost is:\n   \\[\n   0.30 \\times 22000 = 6600 \\text{ euros}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total annual ordering cost:**\n   The total annual ordering cost is the sum of the cost of placing replenishment orders and the annual holding cost:\n   \\[\n   720 + 6600 = 7320 \\text{ euros}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the annual ordering cost is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7320}\n\\]",
            "To determine the annual ordering cost for the Adidas retail store, we need to calculate the total cost of placing replenishment orders over the course of a year. This includes both the cost of the jackets and the fixed cost of each order.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of orders the store places in a year. Since the store places a replenishment order every month, the number of orders per year is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ orders/year} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of jackets ordered in a year. The store sells 650 jackets each month, so the total number of jackets ordered in a year is:\n\\[ 650 \\text{ jackets/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 7800 \\text{ jackets/year} \\]\n\nThe store currently places orders for 550 jackets each time. To find out how many times the store needs to place an order in a year, we divide the total number of jackets ordered in a year by the number of jackets per order:\n\\[ \\frac{7800 \\text{ jackets/year}}{550 \\text{ jackets/order}} = \\frac{7800}{550} = \\frac{156}{11} \\approx 14.18 \\]\n\nSince the store cannot place a fraction of an order, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the store needs to place 15 orders in a year.\n\nNow, we calculate the annual ordering cost. The annual ordering cost consists of the cost of the jackets and the fixed cost of the orders. The cost of the jackets is the total number of jackets ordered in a year multiplied by the cost per jacket:\n\\[ 7800 \\text{ jackets/year} \\times 80 \\text{ euros/jacket} = 624000 \\text{ euros/year} \\]\n\nThe fixed cost of the orders is the number of orders per year multiplied by the fixed cost per order:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ orders/year} \\times 60 \\text{ euros/order} = 900 \\text{ euros/year} \\]\n\nAdding these two amounts gives the total annual ordering cost:\n\\[ 624000 \\text{ euros/year} + 900 \\text{ euros/year} = 624900 \\text{ euros/year} \\]\n\nTherefore, the annual ordering cost is:\n\\[ \\boxed{624900} \\]",
            "To determine the annual ordering cost for the Adidas retail store, we need to calculate the cost of placing the replenishment orders and the holding cost for the inventory.

            "To determine the annual ordering cost for the Adidas retail store in Berlin, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of replenishment orders placed in a year.\n2. Determine the cost of each replenishment order.\n3. Multiply the number of replenishment orders by the cost of each order to get the annual ordering cost.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of replenishment orders placed in a year.**\n\nThe store currently places a replenishment order every month for 550 jackets. Since there are 12 months in a year, the number of replenishment orders placed in a year is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ orders/year} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the cost of each replenishment order.**\n\nThe cost of each replenishment order includes the fixed cost of the order and the cost of the jackets ordered. The fixed cost of a replenishment order is \u20ac60. The cost of the jackets ordered is the number of jackets ordered multiplied by the cost per jacket. Since each jacket costs \u20ac80 and each order is for 550 jackets, the cost of the jackets ordered is:\n\\[ 550 \\text{ jackets} \\times 80 \\text{ euros/jacket} = 44000 \\text{ euros} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of each replenishment order is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ euros} + 44000 \\text{ euros} = 44060 \\text{ euros} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the number of replenishment orders by the cost of each order to get the annual ordering cost.**\n\nThe annual ordering cost is the number of replenishment orders placed in a year multiplied by the cost of each order:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ orders/year} \\times 44060 \\text{ euros/order} = 528720 \\text{ euros/year} \\]\n\nThus, the annual ordering cost is:\n\\[ \\boxed{528720} \\]",

Determine the cost of each replenishment order.\n3. Multiply the number of replenishment orders by the cost of each order to get the annual ordering cost.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of replenishment orders placed in a year.**\n\nThe store sells 650 jackets each month. Since the store places a replenishment order every month for 550 jackets, it will need to place more orders to meet the demand. The number of additional jackets needed each month is:\n\\[ 650 - 550 = 100 \\text{ jackets} \\]\n\nSince each order is for 550 jackets, the number of additional orders needed each month is:\n\\[ \\frac{100}{550} = \\frac{2}{11} \\text{ orders} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of orders placed each month is:\n\\[ 1 + \\frac{2}{11} = \\frac{11}{11} + \\frac{2}{11} = \\frac{13}{11} \\text{ orders} \\]\n\nThe number of orders placed in a year is:\n\\[ \\frac{13}{11} \\times 12 = \\frac{156}{11} \\approx 14.18 \\text{ orders} \\]\n\nSince the number of orders must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number because even a fraction of an order means the store needs to place an additional order. Therefore, the store places 15 orders in a year.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the cost of each replenishment order.**\n\nThe cost of each replenishment order includes the cost of the jackets and the fixed cost of the order. The cost of 550 jackets is:\n\\[ 550 \\times 80 = 44000 \\text{ euros} \\]\n\nThe fixed cost of the order is \u20ac60. Therefore, the total cost of each order is:\n\\[ 44000 + 60 = 44060 \\text{ euros} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the number of replenishment orders by the cost of each order to get the annual ordering cost.**\n\nThe annual ordering cost is:\n\\[ 15 \\times 44060 = 660900 \\text{ euros} \\]\n\nThus, the annual ordering cost is:\n\\[ \\boxed{660900} \\]",

            "To determine the fill rate of the Sam's Club store for HP printers, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the lead time demand:**\n   The lead time for an order is 2 weeks. Given that the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 250 and a standard deviation of 150, the lead time demand is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Lead time demand} = 2 \\times 250 = 500\n   \\]\n   The standard deviation of the lead time demand is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Standard deviation of lead time demand} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 150 \\approx 212.13\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the safety stock:**\n   The store manager orders 1,000 printers each time the inventory drops to 600 printers. Therefore, the safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = 1000 - 600 = 400\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the probability of stockout:**\n   The stockout occurs when the lead time demand exceeds the safety stock. We need to find the probability that a normally distributed random variable with mean 500 and standard deviation 212.13 is greater than 400. This is equivalent to finding \\( P(X > 400) \\) where \\( X \\sim N(500, 212.13^2) \\). First, we convert 400 to a z-score:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{400 - 500}{212.13} \\approx -0.47\n   \\]\n   Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that:\n   \\[\n   P(Z > -0.47) = 1 - P(Z \\leq -0.47) \\approx 1 - 0.3192 = 0.6808\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the probability of stockout is 0.6808, and the probability of not having a stockout (i.e., the fill rate) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Fill rate} = 1 - 0.6808 = 0.3192\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert the fill rate to a percentage:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Fill rate} = 0.3192 \\times 100 \\approx 31.92\\%\n   \\]\n\nThus, the fill rate that the store achieves is \\(\\boxed{31.92\\%}\\)."

            "To determine the savings in safety inventory if the supplier reduces the lead time from nine weeks to one week, we need to calculate the safety inventory for both lead times and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the safety inventory for a nine-week lead time. The cycle service level is 95%, which means we need to find the 95th percentile of the demand distribution over nine weeks. The demand for white shirts each week is normally distributed with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 800. Therefore, the demand over nine weeks is normally distributed with a mean of:\n\n\\[ 9 \\times 2500 = 22500 \\]\n\nand a standard deviation of:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{9} \\times 800 = 3 \\times 800 = 2400 \\]\n\nWe need to find the value of the demand that corresponds to the 95th percentile of this normal distribution.

Since the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 250 and a standard deviation of 150, the lead time demand is also normally distributed with a mean of \\(250 \\times 2 = 500\\) and a standard deviation of \\(150 \\times \\sqrt{2} = 150 \\times 1.414 = 212.13\\).\n\n2. **Determine the safety stock:**\n   The store manager orders 1,000 printers each time the inventory drops to 600 printers. This means that the store will have 600 printers in stock when the order is placed, and after the lead time, the inventory will be \\(600 + 500 = 1100\\) printers if no additional demand occurs during the lead time. However, since the lead time demand is a random variable, we need to find the safety stock that will cover the variability in the lead time demand.\n   \n   The safety stock is the amount of inventory needed to cover the lead time demand beyond the expected value of 500. This can be calculated using the standard normal distribution. We need to find the value of \\(x\\) such that the probability that the lead time demand is less than or equal to \\(x\\) is equal to the probability that the lead time demand is less than or equal to the expected value plus some number of standard deviations.\n   \n   Since the store manager orders when the inventory drops to 600, the safety stock is \\(x - 500\\), where \\(x = 1100 - \\text{expected demand} + \\text{\u5b89\u5168 stock}\\). The safety stock is the z-score corresponding to the desired service level. For simplicity, we can use the z-score corresponding to the service level of 95%, which is approximately 1.645. Therefore, the safety stock is \\(1.645 \\times 212.13 = 350\\).\n   \n   However, since we are given the order quantity and the re order point, we can directly calculate the safety stock as \\(1100 - 600 = 500\\).\n   \n   Therefore, the safety inventory is \\(1100 - 600 = 500\\).\n\nThe safety inventory that the store carries is \\(\\boxed{500}\\)."

            "To determine the average time a jacket spends in inventory, we need to calculate the average inventory level and then divide it by the monthly sales rate.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the average inventory level. The store currently places a replenishment order every month for 550 jackets. This means that after selling 550 jackets in a month, the store places a new order of 550 jackets. The inventory level will range from 550 jackets at the beginning of the month to 0 jackets at the end of the month, with an average inventory level of:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average inventory level} = \\frac{550 + 0}{2} = 275 \\text{ jackets}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long a jacket spends in inventory. Since the average inventory level is 275 jackets and the store sells 650 jackets each month, the average time a jacket spends in inventory is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average time in inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Average inventory level}}{\\text{Monthly sales}} = \\frac{275}{650} \\text{ months}\n\\]\n\nTo convert this into days, we multiply by 30 (assuming there are 30 days in a month):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average time in inventory} = \\frac{275}{650} \\times 30 = \\frac{275 \\times 30}{650} = \\frac{8250}{650} = 12.6923 \\approx 12.69 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average time a jacket spends in inventory is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12.69}\n\\]",
            "To determine the average time a jacket spends in inventory, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total annual demand for jackets:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual demand} = \\text{Monthly demand} \\times 12 = 650 \\times 12 = 7800 \\text{ jackets}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of replenishment orders per year:**\n   Since the store places a replenishment order every month, the number of orders per year is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of orders per year} = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of jackets ordered in a year:**\n   Each order is for 550 jackets, so:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of jackets ordered} = \\text{Number of orders per year} \\times \\text{Jackets per order} = 12 \\times 550 = 6600 \\text{ jackets}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the average number of jackets in inventory:**\n   The average number of jackets in inventory can be found by dividing the total number of jackets ordered by the number of orders per year:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average number of jackets in inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of jackets ordered}}{\\text{Number of orders per year}} = \\frac{6600}{12} = 550 \\text{ jackets}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the average time a jacket spends in inventory:**\n   The average time a jacket spends in inventory is the average number of jackets in inventory divided by the monthly demand:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average time per jacket} = \\frac{\\text{Average number of jackets in inventory}}{\\text{Monthly demand}} = \\frac{550}{650} = \\frac{11}{13} \\text{ months}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average time a jacket spends in inventory is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{11}{13}}\\) months.",

Therefore, the total number of jackets sold per year is:\n   \\[\n   650 \\text{ jackets/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 7800 \\text{ jackets/year}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the average time a jacket spends in inventory:**\n   The average time a jacket spends in inventory is the average number of jackets in inventory divided by the total number of jackets sold per year:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average time in inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Average inventory}}{\\text{Total number of jackets sold per year}} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we calculated:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average time in inventory} = \\frac{3300}{7800} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year}\n   \\]\n   Simplify the fraction:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3300}{7800} = \\frac{11}{26}\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average time in inventory} = \\frac{11}{26} \\times 12 = \\frac{132}{26} = 5.076923076923077 \\approx 5.08 \\text{ months}\n   \\]\n\nThus, on average, a jacket spends approximately \\boxed{5.08} months in inventory.",

However, the problem states that the store currently places a replenishment order every month for 550 jackets, which means the store is not meeting the demand with its current order quantity. This suggests there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or an assumption that the store has a different inventory strategy. Given the problem's constraints, we need to re-eideate the.Inventory strategy.\n\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n   }\n\n\n\n\n\n   queued;\"\n}\"\n\n Leoneuellen(format;\"\n(proxy\u0143 |\n\n setattr\u8e69 slashing

            "To evaluate the service level (CSL) resulting from a policy of ordering 10,000 phones when there are 6,000 phones in inventory, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand over the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 2 weeks, and the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 500. Therefore, the total demand over 2 weeks is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total demand} = 2 \\times 2500 = 5000\n   \\]\n   The standard deviation of the total demand over 2 weeks is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Standard deviation of total demand} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 500 = 500\\sqrt{2} \\approx 707.11\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the target inventory level:**\n   The target inventory level is the initial inventory plus the order quantity. Here, the initial inventory is 6,000 and the order quantity is 10,000, so the target inventory level is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Target inventory level} = 6000 + 10000 = 16000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is the difference between the target inventory level and the expected total demand over the lead time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = 16000 - 5000 = 11000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the service level:**\n   The service level is the probability that the total demand over the lead time will be less than or equal to the target inventory level. This is equivalent to the probability that the total demand minus the expected total demand is less than or equal to the safety stock. We standardize this value using the standard deviation of the total demand:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{11000 - 5000}{707.11} = \\frac{6000}{707.11} \\approx 8.49\n   \\]\n   Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the probability corresponding to \\( Z = 8.49 \\) is approximately 1. This means that the service level is effectively 100%.\n\nTherefore, the service level (CSL) resulting from the policy of ordering 10,000 phones when there are 6,000 phones in inventory is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",

Since the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 250 and a standard deviation of 150, the two-week demand will be normally distributed with a mean of \\(2 \\times 250 = 500\\) and a standard deviation of \\(2 \\times 150 = 300\\).\n\nThe initial inventory level after the order is 1,000 printers.

The current inventory level when an order is placed is 600 printers, so the stockout probability is the probability that the lead time demand exceeds 600 printers. This can be calculated using the standard normal distribution.\n   First, we convert the lead time demand to a standard normal variable:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{600 - 500}{212.13} \\approx \\frac{100}{212.13} \\approx 0.47\n   \\]\n   The probability that a standard normal variable is less than 0.47 is approximately 0.6808.
