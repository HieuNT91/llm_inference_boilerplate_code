Orion currently sells ten\nvariants of a copier, with all inventory kept in finished-goods form. The primary component that differentiates the copiers is the printing subassembly. An idea being discussed is to introduce commonality in the printing subassembly so that final assembly can be postponed and inventories kept in component form. Currently, each copier costs \\$1,000 in terms of components. Introducing commonality in the print subassembly will increase component costs to \\$1,025. One of the ten variants represents 80 percent of the total demand. Weekly demand for this variant is normally distributed, with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 200. Each of the remaining nine variants has a weekly demand of 28 with a standard deviation of 20. Orion aims to provide a 95 percent level of service. Replenishment lead time for components is four weeks. Copier assembly can be completed in a matter of hours.

The sponsor is independently wealthy, so he donates his time and materials to the fundraising effort. Club officers set up a card table in the atrium of the business building and take turns staffing it for the duration of the barbecue season, which is four months. Eighteen sad years of experience have revealed that demand varies depending on the month of the season. Customer demand in the first month can be described as $400-p_1$, in the second month as $400-1.4\\times p_2$, in the third month $400-1.8\\times p_3$, and in the fourth month $400-2.2\\times p_4$. Responding to customer complaints (primarily from period 1 purchasers) the student APICS chapter decides to use static pricing over the four month season. The club sponsor makes a deal with the local bootlegger to supply him with all the mason jars he will need for the barbecue season. What is the total revenue for the season's sales at the optimal price?\nassistant\n",

            "To determine the optimal price and total revenue for the season's sales, we need to maximize the total revenue function over the four months. The revenue for each month is given by the product of the price and the demand for that month. The demand for each month is provided as follows:\n\n- First month: \\(400 - p_1\\)\n- Second month: \\(400 - 1.4p_2\\)\n- Third month: \\(400 - 1.8p_3\\)\n- Fourth month: \\(400 - 2.2p_4\\)\n\nSince the club uses static pricing over the four months, \\(p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = p_4 = p\\). Therefore, the demand for each month simplifies to:\n\n- First month: \\(400 - p\\)\n- Second month: \\(400 - 1.4p\\)\n- Third month: \\(400 - 1.8p\\)\n- Fourth month: \\(400 - 2.2p\\)\n\nThe total revenue \\(R\\) for the season is the sum of the revenues for each month:\n\n\\[\nR = p(400 - p) + p(400 - 1.4p) + p(400 - 1.8p) + p(400 - 2.2p)\n\\]\n\nWe can factor out \\(p\\) from each term:\n\n\\[\nR = p \\left[(400 - p) + (400 - 1.4p) + (400 - 1.8p) + (400 - 2.2p)\\right]\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine the terms inside the brackets:\n\n\\[\n(400 - p) + (400 - 1.4p) + (400 - 1.8p) + (400 - 2.2p) = 400 + 400 + 400 + 400 - p - 1.4p - 1.8p - 2.2p\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 1600 - 6.4p\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this back into the revenue function, we get:\n\n\\[\nR = p(1600 - 6.4p)\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic function in the form \\(R = -6.4p^2 + 1600p\\). To find the maximum revenue, we need to determine the vertex of this parabola. The vertex form of a quadratic function \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) occurs at \\(x = -\\frac{b}{2a}\\).

The weekly demand for this variant is normally distributed with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 200. The lead time is four weeks, so the total demand during the lead time is:\n\\[ 1000 \\times 4 = 4000 \\text{ units} \\]\nThe standard deviation of the total demand during the lead time is:\n\\[ 200 \\times \\sqrt{4} = 400 \\text{ units} \\]\nFor a 95 percent level of service, the z-score is 1.645 (from the standard normal distribution table). Therefore, the safety stock for this variant is:\n\\[ 1.645 \\times 400 = 658 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the safety stock for each of the remaining nine variants. The weekly demand for each of these variants is normally distributed with a mean of 28 and a standard deviation of 20.

Therefore, the safety stock for each of these variants is:\n\\[ 1.645 \\times 40 = 65.8 \\text{ units} \\]\nSince we typically round to the nearest whole number, we will use 66 units for each of these variants.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total safety stock for all ten variants. The safety stock for the variant that represents 80 percent of the total demand is 658 units, and the safety stock for each of the remaining nine variants is 66 units.

All four styles have demand that is normally distributed. The best-selling style has an expected demand of 30,000 and a standard deviation of 5,000. Each of the other three styles has an expected demand of 10,000 with a standard deviation of 4,000 . Currently, all sweaters are produced before the start of the season. Production cost is $\\$ 20$ per sweater, and they are sold for a wholesale price of $\\$ 35$. Any unsold sweaters at the end of the season are discounted to $\\$ 15$, and they all sell at that price. It costs $\\$ 2$ to hold the sweater in inventory for the entire season if it does not sell. TKC is considering the postponement of knitting and using flexible machines. This will require the base sweaters to be made in advance (identical for each of the four types) and the final patterns to be knit later. This will increase production cost per sweater to $\\$21.40$. How many sweaters should TKC manufacture with postponement?\nassistant\n",

Orion currently sells ten\nvariants of a copier, with all inventory kept in finished-goods form. The primary component that differentiates the copiers is the printing subassembly. An idea being discussed is to introduce commonality in the printing subassembly so that final assembly can be postponed and inventories kept in component form. Currently, each copier costs \\$1,000 in terms of components. Introducing commonality in the print subassembly will increase component costs to \\$1,025. One of the ten variants represents 80 percent of the total demand. Weekly demand for this variant is normally distributed, with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 200. Each of the remaining nine variants has a weekly demand of 28 with a standard deviation of 20. Orion aims to provide a 95 percent level of service. Replenishment lead time for components is four weeks. Copier assembly can be completed in a matter of hours. Orion manages all inventories using a continuous review policy and incurs an annual holding cost of 20 percent. How much safety inventory of high volume variant must Orion keep without component commonality?\nassistant\n",

Orion currently sells ten\nvariants of a copier, with all inventory kept in finished-goods form. The primary component that differentiates the copiers is the printing subassembly. An idea being discussed is to introduce commonality in the printing subassembly so that final assembly can be postponed and inventories kept in component form. Currently, each copier costs \\$1,000 in terms of components. Introducing commonality in the print subassembly will increase component costs to \\$1,025. One of the ten variants represents 80 percent of the total demand. Weekly demand for this variant is normally distributed, with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 200. Each of the remaining nine variants has a weekly demand of 28 with a standard deviation of 20. Orion aims to provide a 95 percent level of service. Replenishment lead time for components is four weeks. Copier assembly can be completed in a matter of hours.

Daily demand at the Memphis warehouse is normally distributed, with a mean of 5,000 and a standard deviation of 4,000. The warehouse aims for a CSL of 99 percent. The company is debating whether to use sea or air transportation from China. Sea transportation results in a lead time of 36 days and costs $0.50 per phone. Air transportation results in a lead time of 4 days and costs $1.50 per phone. Each phone costs $100, and Motorola incurs an annual holding cost of 20 percent. Given the minimum lot sizes, Motorola would order 100,000 phones at a time (on average, once every 20 days) if using sea transport and 5,000 phones at a time (on average, daily) if using air transport. To begin with, assume that Motorola takes ownership of the inventory on delivery. Assuming that Motorola follows a continuous review policy, what is the total cost under sea transportation if Motorola does not own the inventory while it is in transit?\nassistant\n",

The standard deviation of the daily demand is 4,000, and the lead time is 36 days.

Daily demand at the Memphis warehouse is normally distributed, with a mean of 5,000 and a standard deviation of 4,000. The warehouse aims for a CSL of 99 percent. The company is debating whether to use sea or air transportation from China. Sea transportation results in a lead time of 36 days and costs $0.50 per phone. Air transportation results in a lead time of 4 days and costs $1.50 per phone. Each phone costs $100, and Motorola incurs an annual holding cost of 20 percent. Given the minimum lot sizes, Motorola would order 100,000 phones at a time (on average, once every 20 days) if using sea transport and 5,000 phones at a time (on average, daily) if using air transport. To begin with, assume that Motorola takes ownership of the inventory on delivery.

Daily demand at the Memphis warehouse is normally distributed, with a mean of 5,000 and a standard deviation of 4,000. The warehouse aims for a CSL of 99 percent. The company is debating whether to use sea or air transportation from China. Sea transportation results in a lead time of 36 days and costs $0.50 per phone. Air transportation results in a lead time of 4 days and costs $1.50 per phone. Each phone costs $100, and Motorola incurs an annual holding cost of 20 percent. Given the minimum lot sizes, Motorola would order 100,000 phones at a time (on average, once every 20 days) if using sea transport and 5,000 phones at a time (on average, daily) if using air transport. To begin with, assume that Motorola takes ownership of the inventory on delivery. Assuming that Motorola follows a continuous review policy, what is the total cost under air transportation if Motorola does not own the inventory while it is in transit?\nassistant\n",

Daily demand at the Memphis warehouse is normally distributed, with a mean of 5,000 and a standard deviation of 4,000. The warehouse aims for a CSL of 99 percent. The company is debating whether to use sea or air transportation from China. Sea transportation results in a lead time of 36 days and costs $0.50 per phone. Air transportation results in a lead time of 4 days and costs $1.50 per phone. Each phone costs $100, and Motorola incurs an annual holding cost of 20 percent. Given the minimum lot sizes, Motorola would order 100,000 phones at a time (on average, once every 20 days) if using sea transport and 5,000 phones at a time (on average, daily) if using air transport. To begin with, assume that Motorola takes ownership of the inventory on delivery. Assuming that Motorola follows a continuous review policy, what is the total cost under air transportation if Motorola has ownership of the inventory while it is in transit?\nassistant\n",

            "To determine the total cost under air transportation, we need to calculate the total cost of ordering, holding inventory, and transportation. We will break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the safety stock required:**\n   The company aims for a CSL of 99 percent. For a normal distribution with a mean of 5,000 and a standard deviation of 4,000, the z-score corresponding to a 99 percent service level is approximately 2.33. The safety stock is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = z \\times \\text{Standard deviation} \\times \\sqrt{\\text{ Lead time}}\n   \\]\n   For air transportation, the lead time is 4 days, so:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = 2.33 \\times 4000 \\times \\sqrt{4} = 2.33 \\times 4000 \\times 2 = 18640\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the average inventory:**\n   The average inventory is the sum of the cycle stock and the safety stock. The cycle stock is the average number of phones ordered per cycle, which is 5,000. Therefore, the average inventory is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average inventory} = \\text{Cycle stock} + \\text{Safety stock} = 5000 + 18640 = 23640\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the holding cost:**\n   The holding cost is 20 percent of the average inventory value. The value of the average inventory is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value of average inventory} = \\text{Average inventory} \\times \\text{Cost per phone} = 23640 \\times 100 = 2364000\n   \\]\n   The holding cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Holding cost} = 0.20 \\times 2364000 = 472800\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the transportation cost:**\n   The transportation cost is the cost per phone multiplied by the number of phones ordered. For air transportation, the number of phones ordered per cycle is 5,000, so:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Transportation cost} = 5000 \\times 1.50 = 7500\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   The total cost is the sum of the holding cost and the transportation cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Holding cost} + \\text{Transportation cost} = 472800 + 7500 = 480300\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost under air transportation if Motorola has ownership of the inventory while it is in transit is \\(\\boxed{480300}\\).",
            "To determine the total cost under air transportation if Motorola has ownership of the inventory while it is in transit, we need to calculate the following components: the economic order quantity (EOQ), the safety stock, the total transportation cost, the total holding cost, and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ):**\n   The EOQ formula is given by:\n   \\[\n   EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times D \\times H}{C}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(D\\) is the annual demand, \\(H\\) is the annual holding cost per phone, and \\(C\\) is the cost per phone.

The lead time for air transportation is 4 days, so we need to find the 99th percentile of the demand over 4 days. The daily demand is normally distributed with a mean of 5,000 and a standard deviation of 4,000.

Orion currently sells ten\nvariants of a copier, with all inventory kept in finished-goods form. The primary component that differentiates the copiers is the printing subassembly. An idea being discussed is to introduce commonality in the printing subassembly so that final assembly can be postponed and inventories kept in component form. Currently, each copier costs \\$1,000 in terms of components. Introducing commonality in the print subassembly will increase component costs to \\$1,025. One of the ten variants represents 80 percent of the total demand. Weekly demand for this variant is normally distributed, with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 200. Each of the remaining nine variants has a weekly demand of 28 with a standard deviation of 20. Orion aims to provide a 95 percent level of service. Replenishment lead time for components is four weeks. Copier assembly can be completed in a matter of hours. Orion manages all inventories using a continuous review policy and incurs an annual holding cost of 20 percent. How much safety inventory must be kept in component form if Orion uses common components for all variants?\nassistant\n",
