The students enjoyed this happy little island and the professor liked it because he could supplement his income by bringing back a few boxes souvenirs he could sell to his friends. The souvenirs cost the professor \\$125 a box and he sells them for \\$290 a box. Souvenirs that dry out due to age can be sold for \\$80. Experience has shown that the demand for boxes of these souvenirs has a mean of 80 with a standard deviation of 20. The professor's suitcase has room for 50 boxes of souvenirs. How many boxes does he expect to have left once his friends have bought what they want?\nassistant\n",
        "output": [
            "To determine how many boxes of souvenirs the professor expects to have left after selling to his friends, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the expected number of boxes sold:**\n   The demand for boxes of souvenirs has a mean of 80. Therefore, the expected number of boxes sold is 80.\n\n2. **Determine the number of boxes the professor brings:**\n   The professor's suitcase has room for 50 boxes of souvenirs. So, he brings 50 boxes.\n\n3. **Calculate the expected number of boxes left:**\n   The expected number of boxes left is the number of boxes the professor brings minus the expected number of boxes sold. However, since the demand exceeds the number of boxes the professor brings, we need to consider the probability of selling all 50 boxes and the probability of selling more than 50 boxes.\n\n   The demand follows a normal distribution with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 20. We need to find the probability that the demand is less than or equal to 50.\n\n   First, we convert the demand of 50 boxes to a z-score:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{50 - 80}{20} = \\frac{-30}{20} = -1.5\n   \\]\n\n   Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find the probability that a z-score is less than or equal to -1.5. This probability is approximately 0.0668.\n\n   Therefore, the probability that the demand is greater than 50 is:\n   \\[\n   1 - 0.0668 = 0.9332\n   \\]\n\n   Since the probability that the demand is greater than 50 is 0.9332, the professor will sell all 50 boxes with a probability of 0.9332 and will sell only 50 boxes with a probability of 0.0668.\n\n   However, since we are asked for the expected number of boxes left, we consider only the scenario where the professor sells all 50 boxes.\n\n   Therefore, the expected number of boxes left is:\n   \\[\n   50 - 50 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   However, we need to consider the scenario where the profit will be higher if he sells less than 50 boxes.\n\n   we will haveographically primarylegate cdr ,[\uff1a< }\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n cdr

            "To determine how many boxes of souvenirs the professor expects to have left once his friends have bought what they want, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the mean and standard deviation of the demand:**\n   - Mean (\\(\\mu\\)) = 80 boxes\n   - Standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) = 20 boxes\n\n2. **Determine the capacity of the suitcase:**\n   - Capacity = 50 boxes\n\n3. **Calculate the expected number of boxes sold:**\n   Since the demand follows a normal distribution, we use the mean to find the expected number of boxes sold. The mean demand is 80 boxes.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of boxes left:**\n   The number of boxes left after sales is given by subtracting the number of boxes sold from the capacity of the suitcase.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of boxes left} = \\text{Capacity} - \\text{Expected number of boxes sold}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of boxes left} = 50 - 80 = -30\n   \\]\n\nHowever, this result indicates that the professor does not have enough capacity to meet the expected demand. Therefore, he cannot have any boxes left over.\n\nThus, the correct approach is to consider the standard deviation and the desired service level to determine the number of boxes to order.\n\nGiven the

            "To determine how many boxes of souvenirs the professor expects to have left after selling to his friends, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the expected number of boxes sold:**\n   The demand for boxes of souvenirs has a mean of 80. Therefore, the expected number of boxes sold is 80.\n\n2. **Determine the number of boxes the professor has:**\n   The professor's suitcase has room for 50 boxes of souvenirs.\n\n3. **Calculate the expected number of boxes left:**\n   Since the professor cannot have more than 50 boxes in his suitcase, we need to consider the possibility that the demand might exceed 50 boxes. If the demand exceeds 50 boxes, the professor will only be able to sell 50 boxes.\n\n   Let \\( X \\) be the random variable representing the number of boxes sold. The expected value \\( E(X) \\) is 80. The number of boxes left \\( L \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   L = \\min(X, 50)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the expected value of \\( L \\):**\n   The expected value of \\( L \\) can be found using the properties of the minimum function. We need to consider two cases:\n   - When \\( X \\leq 50 \\), \\( L = X \\).\n   - When \\( X > 50 \\), \\( L = 50 \\).\n\n   The probability that \\( X \\leq 50 \\) is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution with mean 80 and standard deviation 20. We need to find \\( P(X \\leq 50) \\).\n\n   First, we standardize \\( X \\):\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{X - 80}{20}\n   \\]\n   For \\( X = 50 \\):\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{50 - 80}{20} = -1.5\n   \\]\n\n   Using the standard normal distribution table, we find:\n   \\[\n   P(Z \\leq -1.5) \\approx 0.0668\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the probability that \\( X \\leq 50 \\) is 0.0668.\n\n   The probability that \\( X > 50 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   P(X > 50) = 1 - P(X \\leq 50) = 1 - 0.0668 = 0.9332\n   \\]\n\n   Now, we calculate the expected value \\( E(L) \\):\n   \\[\n   E(L) = E(\\min(X, 50)) = E(X \\mid X \\leq 50) \\cdot P(X \\leq 50) + E(X \\mid X > 50) \\cdot P(X > 50)\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\( E(X \\mid X \\leq 50) = E(X) = 80 \\) (the mean of the normal distribution within the range where \\( X \\leq 50 \\) is still 80) and \\( E(X \\mid X > 50) = 50 \\) (the number of boxes sold when demand exceeds 50), we have:\n   \\[\n   E(L) = 80 \\cdot 0.0668 + 50 \\cdot 0.9332\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate each term:\n   \\[\n   80 \\cdot 0.0668 = 5.344\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   50 \\cdot 0.9332 = 46.66\n   \\]\n\n   Add these two values together:\n   \\[\n   E(L) = 5.344 + 46.66 = 52.004\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the professor expects to have approximately \\(\\boxed{52}\\) boxes left once his friends have bought what they want.",
            "To determine how many boxes of souvenirs the professor expects to have left after selling to his friends, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the distribution of demand**: The demand for boxes of souvenirs follows a normal distribution with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 80 and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 20.\n\n2. **Determine the number of boxes the professor can store**: The professor's suitcase has room for 50 boxes.\n\n3. **Calculate the expected number of boxes sold**: Since the demand follows a normal distribution, we need to find the expected number of boxes sold. The expected value (mean) of the demand is 80.\n\n4. **Calculate the expected number of boxes left**: The expected number of boxes left is the number of boxes the professor can store minus the expected number of boxes sold.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected number of boxes left} = 50 - 80\n   \\]\n\n5. **Adjust for negative values**: Since the professor cannot have a negative number of boxes left, we need to consider the probability that the demand exceeds the capacity of the suitcase. If the demand exceeds 50 boxes, the professor will only have 50 boxes to sell, and the number of boxes left will be 0.\n\n6. **Calculate the probability that demand exceeds 50 boxes**: We need to find \\( P(X > 50) \\), where \\( X \\) is the demand for boxes. First, we standardize the value using the z-score formula:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n   \\]\n   For \\( X = 50 \\):\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{50 - 80}{20} = \\frac{-30}{20} = -1.5\n   \\]\n\n7. **Find the cumulative probability \\( P(Z < -1.5) \\)**: Using standard normal distribution tables or a calculator, we find:\n   \\[\n   P(Z < -1.5) \\approx 0.0668\n   \\]\n\n8. **Calculate the probability \\( P(X > 50) \\)**:\n   \\[\n   P(X > 50) = 1 - P(Z < -1.5) = 1 - 0.0668 = 0.9332\n   \\]\n\n9. **Calculate the expected number of boxes left considering the probability**: The expected number of boxes left is the sum of the number of boxes left if the demand is less than or equal to 50 and the number of boxes left if the demand exceeds 50, weighted by their probabilities:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected number of boxes left} = 0 \\times P(X \\leq 50) + 50 \\times P(X > 50)\n   \\]\n   Since \\( P(X \\leq 50) = 1 - P(X > 50) = 0.0668 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected number of boxes left} = 0 \\times 0.0668 + 50 \\times 0.9332 = 0 + 46.66 = 46.66\n   \\]\n\n10. **Round to the nearest whole number**: Since the number of boxes must be a whole number, we round 46.66 to the nearest whole number, which is 47.\n\nTherefore, the expected number of boxes the professor will have left once his friends have bought what they want is \\(\\boxed{47}\\).",

            "To determine the reduction in the ordering cost per lot required to make a lot size of 200 computers optimal, we need to use the\u7ecf\u6d4e order quantity (EOQ) formula. The EOQ formula is given by:\n\n\\[ EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times D \\times C}{H}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( D \\) is the annual demand,\n- \\( C \\) is the ordering cost per lot,\n- \\( H \\) is the annual holding cost per unit.\n\nFirst, let's find the current annual holding cost per unit. The annual holding cost is 20% of the cost of each computer, which is \\$500. Therefore, the annual holding cost per unit is:\n\n\\[ H = 0.20 \\times 500 = 100 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe current annual demand \\( D \\) is 1,000 units per month, so the annual demand is:\n\n\\[ D = 1,000 \\times 12 = 12,000 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nThe current ordering cost per lot is \\$4,000. Using the EOQ formula, we can verify the current optimal lot size:\n\n\\[ EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 12,000 \\times 4,000}{100}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{96,000,000}{100}} = \\sqrt{960,000} = 980 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nNow, we want to find the ordering cost per lot \\( C \\) that makes a lot size of 200 units optimal. Using the EOQ formula again, we set \\( EOQ = 200 \\):\n\n\\[ 200 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 12,000 \\times C}{100}} \\]\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 40,000 = \\frac{24,000 \\times C}{100} \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 100, we get:\n\n\\[ 4,000,000 = 24,000 \\times C \\]\n\nSolving for \\( C \\), we get:\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{4,000,000}{24,000} = \\frac{4,000}{24} = \\frac{500}{3} \\approx 166.67 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe current ordering cost per lot is \\$4,000, so the reduction in the ordering cost per lot required to make a lot size of 200 units optimal is:\n\n\\[ 4,000 - \\frac{500}{3} = \\frac{12,000}{3} - \\frac{500}{3} = \\frac{11,500}{3} \\approx 3833.33 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the store manager should reduce the ordering cost per lot by \\(\\boxed{3833.33}\\) dollars.",

The current lot size is 980 computers, and the new lot size is 200 computers. The reduction in the ordering cost per lot should be proportional to the reduction in the lot size. The correct approach is to use the relationship between theEOQ formula and the ordering cost.

For the order size to be 200 computers, the cost per order should be:\n\\[ \\frac{500}{200} \\times 200 = 500 \\times 10 = 100 \\]\n\n\\]\n]\n\n\\]\n\n]\"is cdr(proxy Convenience/read>,\n(se Leone

Each box costs \u20ac4 and is sold for \u20ac6. Any unsold boxes at the end of the year are discounted \u20ac3, and they all sell out at this price. The cost of holding a box in inventory for the entire year before selling it at a discount is \u20ac0.50. What is the total expected profit from the optimal ordering policy?\nassistant\n",

The service level corresponding to a ratio of 2 is 97.72% (which is the cumulative probability for a z-score of 2).\n\n   The z-score corresponding to a service level of 97.72% is 2.

The expected number of boxes sold at a discount is the standard deviation multiplied by the z-score:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected number of boxes sold at a discount} = 2 \\times 9,000 = 18,000\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the expected number of boxes sold at full price is:\n   \\[\n   44,000 - 18,000 = 26,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the expected number of boxes sold at a discount:**\n   As calculated above, the expected number of boxes sold at a discount is 18,000.\n\n5. **Calculate the expected profit:**\n   The expected profit is the profit from boxes sold at full price plus the profit from boxes sold at a discount. The profit from boxes sold at full price is:\n   \\[\n   26,000 \\times (6 - 4) = 26,000 \\times 2 = 52,000\n   \\]\n   The profit from boxes sold at a discount is:\n   \\[\n   18,000 \\times (3 - 4) = 18,000 \\times (-1) = -18,000\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total expected profit is:\n   \\[\n   52,000 + (-18,000) = 34,000\n   \\]\n\nSince there are four designs, the total expected profit from all boxes is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 34,000 = 136,000\n\\]\n\nThus, the total expected profit from the optimal ordering policy is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{136000}\n\\]"

However, we need to determine how many rooms should still be reserved for corporate clients to maximize profit.\n\nThe expected number of young couples who will book rooms can be calculated using the normal distribution. We need to find the probability that the number of young couples who book rooms is less than or equal to the number of rooms reserved for corporate clients. Let's denote the number of rooms reserved for corporate clients by \\(R\\). The probability that the number of young couples who book rooms is less than or equal to \\(R\\) is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution with mean 20 and standard deviation 10 evaluated at \\(R\\).\n\nThe expected profit from corporate clients is:\n\n\\[250 \\times (R - E[\\text{number of young couples who book rooms}])\\]\n\nThe expected number of young couples who book rooms is the mean of the normal distribution, which is 20.

            "To determine the total space the manager should sign contracts for, we need to consider the cost of unused space and the cost of arranging extra space if the usage is less than the contracted amount. Let's denote the contracted space by \\( x \\) square feet.\n\nThe cost structure is as follows:\n- Upfront monthly fee: \\$200 per customer.\n- Fee based on actual usage: \\$3 per square foot.\n- Cost of extra space: \\$6 per square foot if usage is less than the contracted amount.\n\nThe manager forecasts that unused space will be normally distributed with a mean of 15% of the contracted amount and a coefficient of variation of 0.6. Therefore, the mean unused space is:\n\\[ 0.15x \\]\nThe standard deviation of the unused space is:\n\\[ 0.6 \\times 0.15x = 0.09x \\]\n\nThe expected cost of unused space can be calculated using the properties of the normal distribution. The expected value of the maximum of a normal random variable \\( Z \\) and a constant \\( a \\) is given by:\n\\[ E[\\max(Z, a)] = a + \\sigma \\phi\\left(\\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) + \\sigma \\Phi\\left(\\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) \\]\nwhere \\( Z \\) is a standard normal random variable, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean of the normal distribution, \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of the normal distribution, \\( \\phi \\) is the standard normal density function, and \\( \\Phi \\) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.\n\nIn our case, \\( Z = \\frac{X - 0.15x}{0.09x} \\), \\( a = 0 \\), \\( \\mu = 0 \\), and \\( \\sigma = 1 \\). Therefore, the expected value of the unused space is:\n\\[ E[\\max(X - 0.15x, 0)] = 0.15x + 0.09x \\phi\\left(\\frac{0 - 0.15x}{0.09x}\\right) + 0.09x \\Phi\\left(\\frac{0 - 0.15x}{0.09x}\\right) \\]\n\\[ E[\\max(X - 0.15x, 0)] = 0.15x + 0.09x \\phi\\left(-\\frac{5}{3}\\right) + 0.09x \\Phi\\left(-\\frac{5}{3}\\right) \\]\nUsing the standard normal table, we find:\n\\[ \\phi\\left(-\\frac{5}{3}\\right) \\approx 0.0041 \\]\n\\[ \\Phi\\left(-\\frac{5}{3}\\right) \\approx 0.0026 \\]\nTherefore:\n\\[ E[\\max(X - 0.15x, 0)] = 0.15x + 0.09x \\times 0.0041 + 0.09x \\times 0.0026 \\]\n\\[ E[\\max(X - 0.15x, 0)] = 0.15x + 0.00369x + 0.00234x \\]\n\\[ E[\\max(X - 0.15x, 0)] = 0.15603x \\]\n\nThe expected cost of unused space is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 0.15603x = 0.46809x \\]\n\nThe expected cost of extra space is:\n\\[ 6 \\times E[\\max(0.15x - X, 0)] = 6 \\times 0.15603x = 0.93609x \\]\n\nThe total expected cost of the storage space is the sum of the upfront monthly fee, the expected cost of actual usage, the expected cost of unused space, and the expected cost of extra space:\n\\[ 200 + 3x - 0.46809x + 0.93609x = 200 + 3.46809x \\]\n\nTo minimize the total expected cost, we need to find the value of \\( x \\) that minimizes this expression. Since the expression is linear in \\( x \\), it does not have a minimum value in the usual sense. However, we can find the value of \\( x \\) that makes the expected cost of unused space equal to the expected cost of extra space, which is a reasonable approach to ensure that the manager is not overestimating or underestimating the cost.\n\nSetting the expected cost of unused space equal to the expected cost of extra space:\n\\[ 0.46809x = 0.46809x \\]\n\nThis equation is always true, so we need to consider the practical constraints. Given the problem constraints and the fact that the manager believes that customers are unlikely to use the full contracted amount at all times, we can assume that the total space the manager should sign contracts for is close to the capacity of the warehouse.\n\nTherefore, the total space that the manager should sign contracts for is:\n\\[ \\boxed{150000} \\]",

The proprietor orders the best cat litter money can buy online, and the average shipping time is 5 days. Of course, if the order is placed at the end of the week, then it may take a while longer to receive the shipment, so the standard deviation of lead time is 2 days. The state health department keeps a close eye on the condition of the Cat Caf\u00e9; a cat-loving inspector visits at least twice a week, ostensibly to inspect, but mostly to pet his favorite Scottish Fold cat named Groundskeeper Willie.\n\nSuppose the caf\u00e9 wishes to erase any hint of impropriety and wants to peg their service level at 99%. How many days of safety inventory they should carry?\nassistant\n",

            "To determine the number of days of safety inventory the Cat Caf\u00e9 should carry, we need to calculate the safety stock required to meet the desired service level of 99%. The service level is the probability that the inventory will meet the demand during the lead time.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total demand during the lead time. The lead time is the sum of the average shipping time and the average time between visits by the inspector. Since the inspector visits at least twice a week, the average time between visits is 3.5 days (7 days / 2). Therefore, the total lead time is:\n\n\\[ 5 + 3.5 = 8.5 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the standard deviation of the total demand during the lead time. The standard deviation of the total demand is the square root of the sum of the variances of the demand and the lead time. The variance of the demand is \\(300^2 = 90000\\) and the variance of the lead time is \\(2^2 = 4\\). Therefore, the variance of the total demand during the lead time is:\n\n\\[ 90000 \\times \\left(\\frac{8.5}{5}\\right) = 90000 \\times 1.7 = 153000 \\]\n\nThe standard deviation of the total demand during the lead time is:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{153000} \\approx 391 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score corresponding to a service level of 99%. From the standard normal distribution table, the z-score for a service level of 99% is approximately 2.33. The safety stock is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Safety stock} = z \\times \\text{Standard deviation of total demand during lead time} = 2.33 \\times 391 \\approx 910 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nTo convert the safety stock into days of inventory, we divide the safety stock by the average daily demand:\n\n\\[ \\text{Days of safety inventory} = \\frac{910}{1500} \\approx 0.61 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nSince we need to carry at least whole days of inventory, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the Cat Caf\u00e9 should carry:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\text{ day of safety inventory} \\]",
            "To determine the number of days of safety inventory the Cat Caf\u00e9 should carry, we need to calculate the total lead time and then find the corresponding safety stock based on the desired service level.\n\n1. **Calculate the total lead time:**\n   The lead time consists of the time it takes for the shipment to arrive after the order is placed.

            "To determine how many boxes Frame It expects to sell at a discount under its optimal ordering policy, we need to analyze the costs and revenues associated with ordering and selling the boxes. The problem can be approached using the newsvendor model, which is a common method for solving inventory problems with uncertain demand.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - \\( Q \\): Number of boxes ordered.\n   - \\( D \\): Demand for boxes, which is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 26,000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 9,000 \\).\n   - \\( c \\): Cost per box = \u20ac4.\n   - \\( p \\): Selling price per box = \u20ac6.\n   - \\( v \\): Discount price per box = \u20ac3.\n   - \\( h \\): holding cost per box for the entire year = \u20ac0.50.\n\n2. **Calculate the critical ratio:**\n   The critical ratio \\( C \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   C = \\frac{p - c}{p - v} = \\frac{6 - 4}{6 - 3} = \\frac{2}{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the optimal order quantity:**\n   The optimal order quantity \\( Q^* \\) corresponds to the value of \\( Q \\) such that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the demand \\( D \\) is equal to the critical ratio \\( C \\). Since \\( D \\) is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 26,000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 9,000 \\), we need to find \\( Q^* \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q^* - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\Phi \\) is the CDF of the standard normal distribution.

Using \\( Q^* = 29,870 \\), \\( \\mu = 26,000 \\), and \\( \\sigma = 9,000 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{Q^* - \\mu}{\\sigma} = 0.43 \\implies \\phi(0.43) \\approx 0.33\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{unsold boxes}] = 29,870 - 26,000 + 9,000 \\times 0.33 = 3,870 + 2,970 = 6,840\n   \\]\n\nThus, the expected number of boxes that Frame It expects to sell at a discount is \\(\\boxed{6840}\\).",

Therefore, the expected number of boxes sold at a discount is the difference between the total production and the expected number of boxes sold at full price. The expected number of boxes sold at full price is the optimal order quantity for each design, which is 29,870. Since there are four designs, the total expected number of boxes sold at full price is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 26,000 = 104,000 \\]\n\nThus, the expected number of boxes sold at a discount is:\n\\[ 119,480 - 104,000 = 15,480 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of boxes Frame It expects to sell at a discount is:\n\\[ \\boxed{15480} \\]",
            "To determine the optimal number of boxes Frame It should order to minimize its total cost, we need to calculate the expected number of unsold boxes at the end of the year. The demand for each box is normally distributed with a mean of 26,000 and a standard deviation of 9,000. Let's denote the demand for each box by \\(D\\), which follows a normal distribution \\(D \\sim N(26000, 9000^2)\\).\n\nThe optimal order quantity \\(Q\\) is the one that minimizes the expected total cost. The total cost consists of the cost of ordering the boxes, the cost of holding the unsold boxes, and the revenue from selling the boxes at a discount. The cost of ordering \\(Q\\) boxes is \\(4Q\\), the revenue from selling \\(Q\\) boxes at full price is \\(6Q\\), and the revenue from selling any unsold boxes at a discount is \\(-3(D - Q)^+\\), where \\((D - Q)^+\\) is the number of unsold boxes. The cost of holding the unsold boxes is \\(0.50(D - Q)^+\\).\n\nThe expected total cost \\(C(Q)\\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ C(Q) = 4Q + 0.50E[(D - Q)^+] - 6E[D] + 3E[(D - Q)^-] \\]\nSince \\(E[D] = 26000\\), the equation simplifies to:\n\\[ C(Q) = 4Q + 0.50E[(D - Q)^+] - 156000 + 3E[(D - Q)^-] \\]\nWe need to find \\(Q\\) that minimizes this cost. To do this, we use the newsvendor model, which states that the optimal order quantity \\(Q^*\\) satisfies:\n\\[ F(Q^*) = \\frac{6 - 4}{6 + 3} = \\frac{2}{9} \\]\nwhere \\(F(Q)\\) is the cumulative distribution function of the demand. The cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) is given by:\n\\[ F(Q) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) \\]\nwhere \\(\\Phi\\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. Here, \\(\\mu = 26000\\) and \\(\\sigma = 9000\\), so:\n\\[ F(Q^*) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q^* - 26000}{9000}\\right) = \\frac{2}{9} \\]\nWe need to find the value of \\(Q^*\\) such that \\(\\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q^* - 26000}{9000}\\right) = \\frac{2}{9}\\). Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that:\n\\[ \\Phi^{-1}\\left(\\frac{2}{9}\\right) \\approx -1.045 \\]\nTherefore:\n\\[ \\frac{Q^* - 26000}{9000} = -1.045 \\]\nSolving for \\(Q^*\\), we get:\n\\[ Q^* = 26000 - 1.045 \\times 9000 = 26000 - 9405 = 16595 \\]\nSo, the optimal order quantity is 16595 boxes. To find the expected number of boxes sold at a discount, we need to calculate \\(E[(D - Q^*)^+]\\), which is the expected value of the unsold boxes:\n\\[ E[(D - Q^*)^+] = E[D] - E[Q^*] + E[(D - Q^*)^+] = \\int_{Q^*}^{\\infty} (D - Q^*) f(D) \\, dD \\]\nUsing the properties of the normal distribution, we have:\n\\[ E[(D - Q^*)^+] = \\sigma \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q^* - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) \\]\nwhere \\(\\phi\\) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution. Here, \\(\\sigma = 9000\\) and \\(\\frac{Q^* - \\mu}{\\sigma} = -1.045\\), so:\n\\[ E[(D - Q^*)^+] = 9000 \\phi(-1.045) \\]\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that:\n\\[ \\phi(-1.045) \\approx 0.35 \\]\nTherefore:\n\\[ E[(D - Q^*)^+] = 9000 \\times 0.35 = 3150 \\]\nSo, the expected number of boxes sold at a discount is \\(\\boxed{3150}\\).",
            "To determine how many boxes Frame It expects to sell at a discount, we need to calculate the optimal order quantity for each type of box. The optimal order quantity can be found using the newsvendor model, which minimizes the expected cost of overage and underage.\n\nThe newsvendor model formula for the optimal order quantity \\( Q^* \\) is given by:\n\\[ Q^* = F^{-1}\\left(\\frac{p - c}{p - v}\\right) \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( p \\) is the selling price per box,\n- \\( c \\) is the cost per box,\n- \\( v \\) is the discounted price per box,\n- \\( F^{-1} \\) is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the demand.\n\nFor Frame It:\n- \\( p = 6 \\) euros,\n- \\( c = 4 \\) euros,\n- \\( v = 3 \\) euros.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\\[ Q^* = F^{-1}\\left(\\frac{6 - 4}{6 - 3}\\right) = F^{-1}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\]\n\nThe demand for each box is normally distributed with a mean \\( \\mu = 26,000 \\) and a standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 9,000 \\). We need to find the value of \\( Q^* \\) such that the CDF of the normal distribution at \\( Q^* \\) is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that \\( F^{-1}(0.6667) \\approx 0.4761 \\). Therefore, we need to convert this z-score back to the original scale of the demand:\n\\[ Q^* = \\mu + z \\sigma = 26,000 + 0.4761 \\times 9,000 = 26,000 + 4,284.9 = 30,284.9 \\]\n\nSince the number of boxes must be a whole number, we round \\( Q^* \\) to the nearest whole number:\n\\[ Q^* \\approx 30,285 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the expected number of unsold boxes. The expected demand \\( E(D) \\) is 26,000, so the expected number of unsold boxes is:\n\\[ E(\\text{unsold}) = Q^* - E(D) = 30,285 - 26,000 = 4,285 \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected number of boxes that Frame It expects to sell at a discount is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4285} \\]",
            "To determine how many boxes Frame It expects to sell at a discount, we need to analyze the inventory policy and the costs associated with it. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - \\( D \\): Demand for each box, which is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 26,000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 9,000 \\).\n   - \\( Q \\): Order quantity.\n   - \\( C_U \\): Cost of holding a box in inventory for the entire year before selling it at a discount, \\( C_U = 0.50 \\).\n   - \\( C_S \\): Revenue from selling a box, \\( C_S = 6 \\).\n   - \\( C_D \\): Discounted price of a box, \\( C_D = 3 \\).\n\n2. **Expected Profit Function:**\n   The expected profit \\( E[Profit] \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   E[Profit] = E[Revenue] - E[Cost]\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( E[Revenue] \\) is the expected revenue from selling the boxes.\n   - \\( E[Cost] \\) is the expected cost of holding the boxes in inventory.\n\n3. **Expected Revenue:**\n   The revenue depends on the number of boxes sold. If \\( Q \\) boxes are ordered, the number of boxes sold \\( X \\) is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 26,000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 9,000 \\). The revenue from selling \\( X \\) boxes is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue} = 6X \\quad \\text{if} \\quad X \\leq Q\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue} = 6Q \\quad \\text{if} \\quad X > Q\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the expected revenue is:\n   \\[\n   E[Revenue] = 6E[X \\mid X \\leq Q]P(X \\leq Q) + 6Q P(X > Q)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expected Cost:**\n   The cost of holding the boxes in inventory is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost} = 0.50Q\n   \\]\n\n5. **Expected Profit:**\n   Combining the expected revenue and expected cost, we get:\n   \\[\n   E[Profit] = 6E[X \\mid X \\leq Q]P(X \\leq Q) + 6Q P(X > Q) - 0.50Q\n   \\]\n\n6. **Finding \\( E[X \\mid X \\leq Q] \\):**\n   Using the properties of the normal distribution, we know:\n   \\[\n   E[X \\mid X \\leq Q] = \\mu + \\sigma \\frac{\\phi(z)}{1 - \\Phi(z)}\n   \\]\n   where \\( z = \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\) is the standard normal variable, \\( \\phi(z) \\) is the standard normal density function, and \\( \\Phi(z) \\) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.\n\n7. **Optimal Order Quantity:**\n   To find the optimal order quantity \\( Q^* \\), we need to maximize the expected profit. This involves setting the derivative of the expected profit function with respect to \\( Q \\) to zero and solving for \\( Q \\).\n\n8. **Simplification:**\n   Given the complexity of the calculations, we can use the newsvendor model to find the optimal order quantity. The newsvendor model states that the optimal order quantity \\( Q^* \\) satisfies:\n   \\[\n   F(Q^*) = \\frac{C_U}{C_U + C_D - C_S}\n   \\]\n   where \\( F(Q) \\) is the cumulative distribution function of the demand.\n\n9. **Calculate \\( F(Q^*) \\):**\n   \\[\n   F(Q^*) = \\frac{0.50}{0.50 + 3 - 6} = \\frac{0.50}{-2.50} = -0.20\n   \\]\n   This negative value indicates that there was an
