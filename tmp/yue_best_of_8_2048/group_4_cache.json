            "To determine the average order size for Liverpool, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand over the lead time and the review period:**\n   - The lead time is 4 weeks.\n   - The review period is 12 weeks.\n   - The total demand over these 16 weeks is the sum of the demand over 4 weeks and the demand over 12 weeks.\n\n   Since the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 3,000 handbags per week, the expected demand over 4 weeks is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 3000 = 12000 \\text{ handbags}\n   \\]\n   The expected demand over 12 weeks is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 3000 = 36000 \\text{ handbags}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total expected demand over 16 weeks is:\n   \\[\n   12000 + 36000 = 48000 \\text{ handbags}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the average order size:**\n   - The order-up-to level is 50,000 handbags.\n   - The average order size is the difference between the order-up-to level and the expected demand over the lead time.\n   - The expected demand over the lead time is 12,000 handbags.\n\n   Therefore, the average order size is:\n   \\[\n   50000 - 12000 = 38000 \\text{ handbags}\n   \\]\n\nThe average order size is \\(\\boxed{38000}\\).",

            "To determine the average order size for Liverpool, we need to calculate the expected demand over the lead time plus the review period minus the current inventory.

Therefore, the expected demand over the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 3000 = 12000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total demand over the review period:**\n   The review period is 12 weeks, so the expected demand over the review period is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 3000 = 36000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the expected demand during the time between orders:**\n   Since the order-up-to level is 50,000 and the current inventory is not specified, we assume that the current inventory is the same as the average inventory over the lead time. The average inventory over the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12000}{4} = 3000\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the expected demand during the time between orders is:\n   \\[\n   36000 - 3000 = 33000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the average order size:**\n   The average order size is the order-up-to level minus the expected demand during the time between orders:\n   \\[\n   50000 - 33000 = 17000\n   \\]\n\nThus, the average order size is \\(\\boxed{17000}\\).",

Determine the safety stock required.\n3. Calculate the average order size using the order-up-to level and the total demand.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total demand over the lead time and the review period.**\n\nThe lead time is 4 weeks, and the review period is 12 weeks. Therefore, the total time from the order to the next order ( lead time + review period ) is:\n\\[ 4 + 12 = 16 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nThe weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 3,000. So, the total demand over 16 weeks is:\n\\[ 16 \\times 3000 = 48000 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the safety stock required.**\n\nThe safety stock is the additional inventory held to account for variability in demand. The standard deviation of the weekly demand is 1,000. The standard deviation of the demand over 16 weeks is:\n\\[ \\sqrt{16} \\times 1000 = 4 \\times 1000 = 4000 \\]\n\nTo determine the safety stock, we need to know the service level. However, since the problem does not specify a service level, we will assume that the order-up-to level is set to cover the total demand over the lead time and the review period plus the safety stock. Therefore, the safety stock is not explicitly needed for the average order size calculation.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the average order size using the order-up-to level and the total demand.**\n\nThe order-up-to level is the maximum inventory level desired. It is given as 50,000. The average order size is the difference between the order-up-to level and the expected demand over the lead time plus the expected demand during the review period minus the expected demand over the lead time (which is already included in the order-up-to level).\n\nSince the order-up-to level is set to cover the total demand over the lead time and the review period, the average order size is simply the order-up-to level minus the total demand over the lead time:\n\\[ 50000 - 0 = 48000 \\]\n\nHowever, since the order-up-to level is set to cover the total demand over the lead time and the review period, the average order size is simply the order-up-to level minus the total demand over the lead time:\n\\[ 50000 - 48000 = 48000]\n\nTherefore, the average order size is:\n\\[

However, since the problem does not specify a service level, we will assume the safety stock is zero for simplicity in this context.\n\n3. **Calculate the average order size:**\n   The order-up-to level is 50,000 units, which means that when the inventory level drops to zero, Liverpool will order up to 50,000 units. The average order size can be calculated by considering the total demand over the re order period (12 weeks) and the safety stock.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average order size} = \\text{Order-up-to level} - \\text{Initial inventory}\n   \\]\n   Since the initial inventory is not specified, we will assume it is zero for simplicity. Therefore, the average order size is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average order size} = 50000 - (12000 - 0) = 50000 - 12000 = 38000 \\text{ units}\n   \\]\n\nHowever, since the problem does not specify the initial inventory, we should consider the total demand over the re order period alone:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average order size} = \\text{Total demand over re order period} + safety stock = \\text{Total demand over re order period} = 38000 units. }\n\n\n\n\n\n:req }\n\n\n\n\n\nubic slashing(IF\ud83c\udf08\uff01\u300d\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044cisor(IFuellenebx

Therefore, the lead time demand \\( D \\) is also normally distributed with:\n   \\[\n   \\mu_D = 300 \\times 2 = 600\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_D = 100 \\times \\sqrt{2} = 100 \\times 1.414 = 141.4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the target inventory level:**\n   DoorRed orders 1,500 units when there are 750 units on hand. Therefore, the target inventory level \\( S \\) is:\n   \\[\n   S = 1500 + 750 = 2250\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the fill rate:**\n   The fill rate is the probability that the inventory level \\( S \\) is greater than or equal to the lead time demand \\( D \\). We need to find \\( P(D \\leq S) \\).\n\n   First, we standardize the lead time demand \\( D \\) using the z-score formula:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{D - \\mu_D}{\\sigma_D}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{2250 - 600}{141.4} = \\frac{1650}{141.4} \\approx 11.66\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the cumulative probability:**\n   Using standard normal distribution tables or a calculator, we find the cumulative probability for \\( Z = 11.66 \\). The cumulative probability for \\( Z = 11.66 \\) is essentially 1 (since 11.66 is far in the right tail of the distribution).\n\n5. **Calculate the fill rate:**\n   Since the cumulative probability is 1, the fill rate is:\n   \\[\n   P(D \\leq S) = 1\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the fill rate that DoorRed achieves with its policy is \\(\\boxed{1}\\). This means that DoorRed will always have enough inventory to meet the demand.",
            "To determine the fill rate that DoorRed achieves with its policy, we need to calculate the probability that the demand for the drug during the two-day lead time does not exceed the on-hand inventory plus the replenishment order. Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the lead time and the on-hand inventory plus the replenishment order:**\n   - Lead time = 2 days\n   - On-hand inventory = 750 units\n   - Replenishment order = 1,500 units\n   - Total inventory after replenishment = 750 + 1,500 = 2,250 units\n\n2. **Calculate the expected demand over the two-day lead time:**\n   - Mean daily demand = 300 units\n   - Expected demand over 2 days = 300 * 2 = 600 units\n\n3. **Calculate the standard deviation of the demand over the two-day lead time:**\n   - Standard deviation of daily demand = 100 units\n   - Standard deviation of demand over 2 days = \\(100 \\sqrt{2} = 100 \\times 1.414 = 141.4\\) units\n\n4. **Determine the probability that the demand over the two-day lead time does not exceed the total inventory:**\n   - We need to find \\(P(\\text{Demand} \\leq 2250)\\).\n   - First, convert the demand to a standard normal variable \\(Z\\):\n     \\[\n     Z = \\frac{2250 - 600}{141.4} = \\frac{1650}{141.4} \\approx 11.66\n     \\]\n   - Using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that \\(P(Z \\leq 11.66) \\approx 1\\).\n\nSince the probability \\(P(Z \\leq 11.66)\\) is very close to 1, the fill rate that DoorRed achieves with its policy is approximately 100%.\n\nTherefore, the fill rate is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",
            "To determine the fill rate that DoorRed achieves with its policy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the lead time demand:**\n   The lead time is 2 days, and the daily demand is normally distributed with a mean of 300 units and a standard deviation of 100 units. Therefore, the lead time demand \\( D_{\\text{ lead time}} \\) is also normally distributed with:\n   \\[\n   \\mu_{D_{\\text{ lead time}}} = 2 \\times 300 = 600 \\text{ units}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{D_{\\text{ lead time}}} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 100 = 100\\sqrt{2} \\approx 141.42 \\text{ units}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the target inventory level:**\n   The replenishment policy is to order 1,500 units when there are 750 units on hand. Therefore, the target inventory level \\( S \\) is:\n   \\[\n   S = 750 + 1500 = 2250 \\text{ units}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the fill rate:**\n   The fill rate is the probability that the inventory level will be at least equal to the lead time demand. We need to find \\( P(D_{\\text{ lead time}} \\leq S) \\).\n\n   First, standardize the lead time demand \\( D_{\\text{ lead time}} \\) to a standard normal variable \\( Z \\):\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{S - \\mu_{D_{\\text{ lead time}}}}{\\sigma_{D_{\\text{ lead time}}}} = \\frac{2250 - 600}{141.42} \\approx \\frac{1650}{141.42} \\approx 11.68\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the probability using the standard normal distribution:**\n   Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, find \\( P(Z \\leq 11.68) \\). The value of \\( P(Z \\leq 11.68) \\) is essentially 1, as 11.68 is far in the right tail of the distribution.\n\nTherefore, the fill rate that DoorRed achieves with its policy is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",
            "To determine the fill rate that DoorRed achieves with its policy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the lead time and the initial inventory:**\n   - Lead time (L) = 2 days\n   - Initial inventory (I) = 750 units\n\n2. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   - Daily demand (D) is normally distributed with a mean of 300 units and a standard deviation of 100 units.\n   - The total demand during the lead time (D_L) is also normally distributed with a mean of \\( D \\times L \\) and a standard deviation of \\( \\sigma_D \\times \\sqrt{L} \\).\n   - Mean of D_L: \\( 300 \\times 2 = 600 \\) units\n   - Standard deviation of D_L: \\( 100 \\times \\sqrt{2} = 100 \\times 1.414 = 141.4 \\) units\n\n3. **Determine the target inventory level:**\n   - DoorRed orders 1,500 units when there are 750 units on hand.\n   - The target inventory level (T) is the initial inventory plus the order quantity: \\( 750 + 1500 = 2250 \\) units.\n\n4. **Calculate the probability that the inventory level will be below the target level during the lead time:**\n   - We need to find the probability that the total demand during the lead time (D_L) is less than or equal to the target inventory level minus the initial inventory: \\( 2250 - 750 = 1500 \\) units.\n   - Convert this to a standard normal distribution problem using the Z-score formula:\n     \\[\n     Z = \\frac{D_L - \\text{Mean of } D_L}{\\text{Standard deviation of } D_L} = \\frac{1500 - 600}{141.4} = \\frac{900}{141.4} \\approx 6.36\n     \\]\n\n5. **Find the cumulative probability corresponding to the Z-score:**\n   - Using standard normal distribution tables or a calculator, the cumulative probability for \\( Z = 6.36 \\) is approximately 1 (or 99.9997%).\n\n6. **Calculate the fill rate:**\n   - The fill rate is the probability that the inventory level will be above the target level during the lead time, which is \\( 1 - \\text{cumulative probability} \\).\n   - Since the cumulative probability is 1, the fill rate is:\n     \\[\n     1 - 1 = 0\n     \\]\n\nHowever, this result is not correct. reiates ste }\n\n\n\n\n\nspmographically ste disappe Infantry steuellen NPCs)>\n

            "To determine the optimal order size for Grainger, we need to use the economic order quantity (EOQ) formula. The EOQ formula is given by:\n\n\\[ EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times D \\times C}{H}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( D \\) is the annual demand,\n- \\( C \\) is the cost per order,\n- \\( H \\) is the annual holding cost per unit.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total annual demand \\( D \\). Since Grainger sources from hundreds of suppliers and each supplier has an average annual demand of 10,000 units, we need to determine the total number of suppliers. However, the problem does not specify the exact number of suppliers, so we will assume it is such that the total annual demand can be effectivelyAGgregated to a single order. For simplicity, we can assume the number of suppliers is such that the total annual demand is a multiple of the truck capacity. Given that each truck has a capacity of 2,500 units, we can assume the total annual demand is a multiple of this number. Let's assume the total annual demand is \\( N \\times 2,500 \\) units, where \\( N \\) is an integer.\n\nThe cost per order \\( C \\) includes the truckload shipping cost and the pickup cost. The truckload shipping cost is \\$500 per truck, and the pickup cost is \\$100 per pickup. Since each truck carries 2,500 units, the number of pickups per truck is 1. Therefore, the cost per order is:\n\n\\[ C = 500 + 100 \\times 1 = 600 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe annual holding cost per unit \\( H \\) is 20% of the unit cost. The unit cost is \\$50, so:\n\n\\[ H = 0.20 \\times 50 = 10 \\text{ dollars per unit} \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute \\( D = N \\times 2,500 \\), \\( C = 600 \\), and \\( H = 10 \\) into the EOQ formula:\n\n\\[ EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times N \\times 2,500 \\times 600}{10}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3,000,000N}{10}} = \\sqrt{300,000N} = 547.72\\sqrt{N} \\]\n\nSince \\( N \\) must be an integer such that \\( N \\times 2,500 \\) is a multiple of the truck capacity, \\( N \\) must be an integer. To find the optimal order size, we need to find the smallest integer \\( N \\) such that \\( 547.72\\sqrt{N} \\) is an integer multiple of 2,500. By trial and error or using a calculator, we find that \\( N = 4 \\) gives us:\n\n\\[ EOQ = 547.72 \\times \\sqrt{4} = 547.72 \\times 2 = 1,095.44 \\approx 1,100 \\]\n\nHowever, since the truck capacity is 2,500 units, the optimal order size must be a multiple of 2,500. Therefore, the smallest multiple of 2,500 that is greater than or equal to 1,100 is 2,500.\n\nThus, the optimal order size is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2500} \\]",

Since Grainger sources from hundreds of suppliers and each supplier has an average annual demand of 10,000 units, we need to know the exact number of suppliers. However, since the problem does not specify the exact number of suppliers, we will assume a reasonable number. For simplicity, let's assume Grainger sources from 10 suppliers (this is a common assumption in such problems if not specified otherwise).\n\n\\[ D = 10 \\times 10,000 = 100,000 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nNext, the cost per unit \\( C \\) is given as \\$50.\n\nThe annual holding cost per unit \\( H \\) is 20% of the cost per unit.\n\\[ H = 0.20 \\times 50 = 10 \\text{ dollars per unit} \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the EOQ formula:\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 100,000 \\times 50}{10}} \\]\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{10,000,000}{10}} \\]\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{1,000,000} \\]\n\\[ Q^* = 1,000 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nHowever, since each truck has a capacity of 2,500 units and we cannot order a fraction of a truck, we need to check if ordering 1,000 units is feasible.

The optimal order size \\( Q \\) should be the truck capacity because any smaller order size would result in higher shipping costs due to the fixed cost per truck.\n\nTherefore, the optimal order size is:\n\\[ Q = 2500 \\]\n\nSo, the optimal order size is \\(\\boxed{2500}\\).",

            "To determine the optimal order size for Grainger, we need to use the economic order quantity (EOQ) formula. The EOQ formula is given by:\n\n\\[ EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times D \\times C}{H}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( D \\) is the total annual demand,\n- \\( C \\) is the cost per order,\n- \\( H \\) is the annual holding cost per unit.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total annual demand \\( D \\). Since Grainger sources from hundreds of suppliers and each supplier has an average annual demand of 10,000 units, we need to know the exact number of suppliers. However, since the problem does not specify the exact number of suppliers, we will assume it is large enough to make the calculation practical. For simplicity, let's assume there are 100 suppliers (a common number for such problems). Therefore, the total annual demand is:\n\n\\[ D = 100 \\times 10,000 = 1,000,000 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost per order \\( C \\). The cost per order consists of the truckload shipping cost and the pickup cost. Since each truck has a capacity of 2,500 units, the number of trucks required for an order \\( Q \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of trucks} = \\frac{Q}{2,500} \\]\n\nThe total shipping cost is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Shipping cost} = 500 \\times \\frac{Q}{2,500} = 200Q \\]\n\nThe pickup cost is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Pickup cost} = 100Q \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost per order \\( C \\) is:\n\n\\[ C = 200Q + 100Q = 300Q \\]\n\nHowever, since we need to use the EOQ formula, we need to consider the cost per unit of order, which is the sum of the fixed cost per truck and the pickup cost per unit. The fixed cost per unit is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Fixed cost per unit} = \\frac{500 + 100}{2,500} = \\frac{600}{2,500} = 0.24 \\text{ dollars per unit} \\]\n\nThus, the total cost per order \\( C \\) can also be expressed as:\n\n\\[ C = 0.24Q \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the annual holding cost per unit \\( H \\). The annual holding cost is 20 percent of the unit cost, which is \\$50. Therefore, the annual holding cost per unit is:\n\n\\[ H = 0.20 \\times 50 = 10 \\text{ dollars per unit} \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute \\( D \\), \\( C \\), and \\( H \\) into the EOQ formula:\n\n\\[ EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 1,000,000 \\times 200Q}{10}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 1,000,000 \\times 300Q}{10}} \\]\n\nHowever, since we need to use the correct cost per unit per order and

            "To determine the optimal order size for Grainger, we need to use the\u7ecf\u6d4e order quantity (EOQ) formula. The EOQ formula is given by:\n\n\\[ EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times D \\times C}{H}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( D \\) is the annual demand,\n- \\( C \\) is the cost per order,\n- \\( H \\) is the annual holding cost per unit.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the annual demand \\( D \\). Since Grainger sources from hundreds of suppliers and each supplier has an average annual demand of 10,000 units, we need to know the total number of suppliers. However, the problem does not specify the exact number of suppliers. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume there are \\( n \\) suppliers. The total annual demand \\( D \\) is then:\n\n\\[ D = 10,000 \\times n \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cost per order \\( C \\). The cost per order consists of the truckload shipping cost and the cost of picking up the units. The truckload shipping cost is \\$500 per truck, and each truck has a capacity of 2,500 units. Therefore, the shipping cost per unit is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Shipping cost per unit} = \\frac{500}{2,500} = 0.2 \\text{ dollars per unit} \\]\n\nThe cost of picking up the units is \\$100 per pickup. Since each truck can carry 2,500 units, the number of picks up per order is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of picks up per order} = \\frac{2,500}{2,500} = 1 \\]\n\nThus, the total cost per order \\( C \\) is:\n\n\\[ C = 500 + 100 \\times 1 = 600 \\text{ dollars per order} \\]\n\nThe annual holding cost per unit \\( H \\) is 20% of the cost of each unit. Since each unit costs \\$50, the holding cost per unit is:\n\n\\[ H = 0.2 \\times 50 = 10 \\text{ dollars per unit per year} \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute \\( D \\), \\( C \\), and \\( H \\) into the EOQ formula:\n\n\\[ EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 10,000 \\times n \\times 600}{10}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{12,000,000n}{10}} = \\sqrt{1,200,000n} = 1,095.45 \\sqrt{n} \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) is the number of suppliers, and we don't have the exact number, let's assume the number of suppliers is such that the order size can be an integer and fit within the truck capacity. The closest integer value for \\( \\sqrt{n} \\) that makes \\( 1,095.45 \\sqrt{n} \\) a multiple of 2,500 is 4 (since \\( 1,095.45 \\times 4 = 4,381.8 \\approx 2,500 \\times 2 \\)).\n\nTherefore, the optimal order size is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2500} \\]",
            "To determine the optimal order size for Grainger, we need to consider both the cost of shipping and the cost of holding inventory. The total cost includes the shipping cost and the holding cost. The shipping cost consists of the truckload cost and the pickup cost, while the holding cost is a function of the average inventory level.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- \\( Q \\): order size (number of units per order)\n- \\( D \\): annual demand (10,000 units)\n- \\( C \\): cost per unit (\\$50)\n- \\( H \\): annual holding cost rate (20%)\n- \\( T \\): truckload shipping cost (\\$500)\n- \\( P \\): pickup cost (\\$100)\n- \\( C_{\\text{truck}} \\): cost per truckload (\\$500)\n- \\( C_{\\text{pickup}} \\): cost per pickup (\\$100)\n- \\( C_{\\text{unit}} \\): total cost per unit (\\$50)\n- \\( C_{\\text{holding}} \\): annual holding cost (\\$50 \\times Q \\times 0.20 = \\$10Q)\n\nThe number of trucks required to transport \\( Q \\) units is \\( \\frac{Q}{2500} \\). Therefore, the total shipping cost is:\n\\[ \\text{Shipping cost} = \\frac{Q}{2500} \\times 500 + \\frac{Q}{2500} \\times 2 \\times 100 = \\frac{Q}{2500} \\times 500 + \\frac{Q}{2500} \\times 200 = \\frac{Q}{2500} \\times 700 = \\frac{700Q}{2500} = \\frac{7Q}{25} \\]\n\nThe total cost \\( C \\) is the sum of the shipping cost and the holding cost:\n\\[ C = \\frac{7Q}{25} + 10Q = Q \\left( \\frac{7}{25} + 10 \\right) = Q \\left( \\frac{7 + 250}{25} \\right) = Q \\left( \\frac{257}{25} \\right) = \\frac{257Q}{25} \\]\n\nTo minimize the total cost, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that minimizes \\( \\frac{257Q}{25} \\). However, since \\( Q \\) must be an integer and the cost function is linear, we need to consider the practical constraints. The order size \\( Q \\) must be a multiple of the truck capacity, which is 2,500 units.\n\nTo find the optimal order size, we need to consider the holding cost and the shipping cost. The holding cost increases with the order size, while the shipping cost decreases with the order size. The optimal order size is the one that balances these two costs.\n\nSince the holding cost is proportional to the order size and the shipping cost is inversely proportional to the order size, the optimal order size is the truck capacity itself, which is 2,500 units. This is because any larger order size would increase the holding cost without a significant decrease in the shipping cost.\n\nTherefore, the optimal order size is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2500} \\]",
            "To determine the optimal order size for Grainger, we need to consider both the shipping cost and the holding cost. The total cost \\(C\\) for an order size \\(Q\\) is given by the sum of the shipping cost and the holding cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping cost consists of the fixed cost per truck and the variable cost per unit picked up. The number of trucks required to ship \\(Q\\) units is \\(Q / 2500\\). Therefore, the shipping cost is:\n\\[\n\\text{Shipping cost} = 500 \\left(\\frac{Q}{2500}\\right) + 100 \\left(\\frac{Q}{2500}\\right) = \\frac{600Q}{2500} = \\frac{6Q}{25}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the holding cost. The holding cost is 20% of the total value of the inventory. The total value of the inventory is the order size \\(Q\\) multiplied by the cost per unit, which is \\$50. Therefore, the holding cost is:\n\\[\n\\text{Holding cost} = 0.20 \\times 50Q = 10Q\n\\]\n\nThe total cost \\(C\\) for an order size \\(Q\\) is the sum of the shipping cost and the holding cost:\n\\[\nC = \\frac{6Q}{25} + 10Q = \\frac{6Q + 250Q}{25} = \\frac{256Q}{25}\n\\]\n\nTo minimize the total cost, we need to find the order size \\(Q\\) that minimizes the total cost function. However, since the total cost function \\(C = \\frac{256Q}{25}\\) is a linear function and increases as \\(Q\\) increases, the minimum cost occurs when \\(Q\\) is as small as possible while still meeting the demand from the suppliers. Given that each supplier has an average annual demand of 10,000 units and Grainger sources from hundreds of suppliers, the total annual demand is:\n\\[\n10,000 \\times 100 = 1,000,000 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\nSince each truck has a capacity of 2,500 units, the minimum number of trucks required to ship 1,000,000 units is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1,000,000}{2,500} = 400\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the optimal order size is:\n\\[\nQ = 400 \\times 2,500 = 1,000,000 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\nHowever, since each truck has a capacity of 2,500 units, the minimum order size that meets the demand from each supplier is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2500}\n\\]"

The profit from selling the discs is the revenue from selling the discs minus the cost of the discs. The revenue from selling the discs is the retail price per disc times the number of discs sold, and the cost of the discs is the cost per disc times the number of discs ordered.\n\nThe profit function can be written as:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 10 \\cdot \\min(q, D) - 1 \\cdot q \\]\n\nThe expected profit is the expected value of the profit function:\n\\[ \\text{Expected Profit} = E[10 \\cdot \\min(q, D) - 1 \\cdot q] = 10 \\cdot E[\\min(q, D)] - q \\]\n\nTo find \\( E[\\min(q, D)] \\), we need to use the properties of the normal distribution.

            "To determine the supply chain profits with an independent retailer, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the expected number of discs sold:**\n   The market demand is normally distributed with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 1,000 and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 300. The retailer sells each disc at \\$10, and the supplier sells each disc to the retailer at \\$5.

The expected profit for the retailer is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit for retailer} = 5 \\times \\text{Expected number of discs sold}\n   \\]\n   The expected number of discs sold is the mean of the normal distribution, which is 1,000.

The retailer sells each disc at \\$10, and the supplier sells each disc to the retailer at \\$5. The retailer's profit per disc is \\(10 - 5 = \\$5\\).\n\n2. **Determine the optimal order quantity:**\n   The optimal order quantity is the quantity that maximizes the retailer's expected profit. This can be found using the critical fractile formula for the newsvendor problem. The critical fractile \\(F^*\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F^* = \\frac{p - c}{p - v}\n   \\]\n   where \\(p\\) is the retail price, \\(c\\) is the cost to the retailer from the supplier, and \\(v\\) is the value of the unsold discs (which is 0 in this case). Plugging in the values, we get:\n   \\[\n   F^* = \\frac{10 - 5}{10 - 0} = \\frac{5}{10} = 0.5\n   \\]\n   The critical fractile of 0.5 corresponds to the median of the normal distribution. Since the normal distribution is symmetric, the median is equal to the mean. Therefore, the optimal order quantity is 1,000 discs.\n\n3. **Calculate the expected profit for the retailer:**\n   Since the optimal order quantity is 1,000 discs and the mean demand is also 1,000 discs, the expected number of discs sold is 1,000. The expected profit for the retailer is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit for the retailer} = 1000 \\times (10 - 5) = 1000 \\times 5 = 5000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the expected profit for the supplier:**\n   The supplier sells each disc to the retailer at \\$5. Since the retailer orders 1,000 discs, the expected profit for the supplier is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit for the supplier} = 1000 \\times (5 - 1) = 1000 \\times 4 = 4000\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total supply chain profit:**\n   The total supply chain profit is the sum of the expected profits for the retailer and the supplier:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total supply chain profit} = 5000 + 4000 = 9000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the supply chain profits with an independent retailer are \\(\\boxed{9000}\\).",

            "To determine the safety stock that should be held to put the expected shortage per cycle at 5 phones, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total expected demand over the lead time.\n2. Determine the expected shortage given the current safety stock.\n3. Adjust the safety stock to achieve the desired expected shortage.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total expected demand over the lead time.**\n\nThe lead time is 3 weeks and the average weekly demand is 1500 phones. Therefore, the total expected demand over the lead time is:\n\\[ 1500 \\text{ phones/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 4500 \\text{ phones} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the expected shortest given the current safety stock.**\n\nThe current safety stock is 500 phones, and the lot size is 350 phones. The total available inventory when an order is placed is the safety stock plus the lot size:\n\\[ 500 \\text{ phones} + 350 \\text{ phones} = 850 \\text{ phones} \\]\n\nThe expected shortage per cycle is the total expected demand over the lead time minus the total available inventory:\n\\[ 4500 \\text{ phones} - 850 \\text{ phones} = 3650 \\text{ phones} \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation is not directly useful because it does not account for the variability in demand. We need to use the standard deviation of the demand to find the correct safety stock.\n\n**Step 3: Adjust the safety stock to achieve the desired expected shortage.**\n\nThe expected shortage per cycle can be expressed in terms of the standard deviation of the demand. We want the expected shortage to be 5 phones. Let \\( S \\) be the safety stock. The total available inventory when an order is placed is \\( S + 350 \\) phones. The expected shortest is:\n\\[ 4500 - (S + 350) = 4500 - S - 350 = 4150 - S \\]\n\nWe need this expected shortest to be equal to the desired expected shortage of 5 phones. Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\\[ 4150 - S = 5 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( S \\):\n\\[ S = 4150 - 5 = 4145 \\]\n\nThus, the safety stock that should be held to put the expected shortage per cycle at 5 phones is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4145} \\]",
            "To determine the safety stock that should be held to put the expected shortage per cycle at 5 phones, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 3 weeks, and the average weekly demand is 1500 phones.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total demand during lead time} = 1500 \\times 3 = 4500 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the standard deviation of the demand during the lead time:**\n   The standard deviation of the weekly demand is 145 phones. Since the lead time is 3 weeks, the standard deviation of the demand during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Standard deviation of demand during lead time} = 145 \\times \\sqrt{3} \\approx 145 \\times 1.732 \\approx 250.64 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the safety stock required to achieve an expected shortage of 5 phones:**\n   Let \\( z \\) be the z-score corresponding to the desired service level. The expected shortage per cycle is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected shortage per cycle} = \\text{Total demand during lead time} - \\text{ lot size} - \\text{safety stock} + z \\times \\text{Standard deviation of demand during lead time}\n   \\]\n   We want the expected shortage to be 5 phones, so:\n   \\[\n   5 = 4500 - 350 - \\text{safety stock} + z \\times 250.64\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   5 = 4150 - \\text{safety stock} + z \\times 250.64\n   \\]\n   Rearranging to solve for safety stock, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{safety stock} = 4150 - 5 - z \\times 250.64 = 4145 - z \\times 250.64\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the z-score for an expected shortage of 5 phones:**\n   The z-score can be found using the standard normal distribution. We need to find the z-score such that the area under the standard normal curve to the right of \\( z \\) is equal to the probability of a shortage of 5 phones. Since we want the expected shortage to be 5 phones, we can use the properties of the normal distribution to find the corresponding z-score. However, we can also use the given safety stock of 500 phones to find the z-score for this safety stock.\n   \\[\n   \\text{safety stock} = \\text{ lead time demand} + z \\times \\text{ standard deviation of demand during lead time}\n   \\]\n   Using the given safety stock of 500 phones:\n   \\[\n   500 = 4500 + z \\times \\text{ standard deviation of demand during lead time} + z \\times \\text{ standard deviation of demand during lead time} - z \\times \\text{ standard deviation of demand during lead time} + z \\times 250.64\n   \\]\n   Using the given safety stock of 350

Since the lead time is 3 weeks, we need to find the standard deviation of the total demand over these 3 weeks.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Standard deviation of total demand} = \\sqrt{3} \\times 145 \\approx 251.66 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set up the equation for the safety stock:**\n   Let \\( S \\) be the safety stock. The total available inventory (including the safety stock) is the lot size plus the safety stock:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total available inventory} = 350 + S\n   \\]\n   We want the probability that the total demand during the lead time does not exceed the total available inventory to be at least 0.99. This can be expressed using the standard normal distribution:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Total demand} \\leq 350 + S) = 0.99\n   \\]\n   The z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.99 is approximately 2.326 (from standard normal distribution tables).\n\n4. **Convert the z-score to the safety stock:**\n   The z-score formula is:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{\\text{Total demand} - \\text{ Mean demand}}{\\text{ Standard deviation of demand}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the values, we get:\n   \\[\n   2.326 = \\frac{4500 + S - 4500}{251.66}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we find:\n   \\[\n   2.326 = \\frac{S}{251.66}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( S \\):\n   \\[\n   S = 2.326 \\times 251.66 \\approx 585\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the safety stock that Marlo Stanfield should hold to put the fill rate at 0.99 is \\(\\boxed{585}\\)."

Since the lot size is now half, the target inventory level should also be reduced by half:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New target inventory level} = \\frac{600}{2} = 300 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the lead time demand:**\n   The lead time is 3 weeks, and the weekly demand is 200 bananas. Therefore, the lead time demand is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Lead time demand} = 3 \\times 200 = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is the difference between the lead time demand and the target inventory level:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = \\text{Lead time demand} - \\text{Target inventory level} = 600 - 300 = 300 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the standard deviation of the lead time demand:**\n   The standard deviation of the weekly demand is 50 bananas.

Therefore, the lead time demand is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ leads time demand} = 3 \\times 200 = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is the amount of inventory needed to ensure that the demand during the lead time is met. Since the inventory drops to 600 when an order is placed, the safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ safety stock} = \\text{ lead time demand} - \\text{ inventory when order is placed} = 600 - 600 = 0 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   However, this calculation is incorrect because we need to consider the new lot size and the lead time demand. The correct safety stock calculation should be based on the lead time demand minus the average inventory level when an order is placed. The average inventory level when an order is placed is half of the new lot size:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ average inventory level} = \\frac{500}{2} = 250 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   The safety stock is then:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ safety stock} = \\text{ lead time demand} - \\text{ average inventory level} = 600 - 250 = 350 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the standard deviation of the lead time demand:**\n   The standard deviation of the weekly demand is 50 bananas. Therefore, the standard deviation of the lead time demand is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ standard deviation of lead time demand} = \\sqrt{3} \\times 50 \\approx 86.60 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the z-score for the safety stock:**\n   The z-score is calculated by dividing the safety stock by the standard deviation of the lead time demand:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{\\text{ safety stock}}{\\text{ standard deviation of lead time demand}} = \\frac{350}{86.60} \\approx 4\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find the customer service level:**\n   The z-score of 4 corresponds to a customer service level of approximately 99.99% (from standard normal distribution tables).\n\nTherefore, the new customer service level is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{99.99}\n\\]",

Therefore, the lead time demand is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Lead time demand} = 3 \\times 200 = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the safety stock required for the new lot size:**\n   The safety stock is the difference between the lead time demand and the inventory level when an order is placed. originally, the inventory level when an order is placed is 600 bananas, which is equal to the lead time demand. This means the original safety stock is 0. When the lot size is cut in half to 500 bananas, the safety stock required is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New safety stock} = \\text{Lead time demand} - \\text{New lot size} + \\text{Original safety stock} = 600 - 500 + 0 = 100 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   However, since we are dealing with a new lot size that is less than the lead time demand, we need to find the safety stock that corresponds to the desired service level. The safety stock can also be expressed in terms of the standard deviation of the lead time demand. The standard deviation of the lead time demand is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Standard deviation of lead time demand} = \\sqrt{3} \\times 50 \\approx 86.60 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   Let \\( z \\) be the number of standard deviations corresponding to the new service level. Then:\n   \\[\n   z \\times 86.60 = 100 \\implies z = \\frac{100}{86.60} \\approx 1.15\n   \\]\n   Using standard normal distribution tables, a \\( z \\)-score of 1.15 corresponds to a service level of approximately 87.49%.\n\nTherefore, the new customer service level is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{87.49\\%}\n\\]",

Therefore, the lead time demand is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Lead time demand} = 200 \\times 3 = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the original service level:**\n   The safety stock is 400 bananas, and the lead time demand is 600 bananas. The service level is the probability that the lead time demand will be less than or equal to the safety stock plus the lead time demand. Since the demand follows a normal distribution with a mean of 600 and a standard deviation of \\(50 \\times \\sqrt{3} = 86.60\\), we need to find the z-score:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{400 - 600}{86.60} = \\frac{-200}{86.60} \\approx -2.29\n   \\]\n   Using a standard normal distribution table, the probability corresponding to \\(z = -2.29\\) is approximately 0.0107.

            "To determine the new customer service level after the Banana Stand cuts their lot size in half, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial lot size and the new lot size:**\n   The initial lot size is 1000 bananas. After cutting the lot size in half, the new lot size is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1000}{2} = 500 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the initial safety stock:**\n   The initial safety stock is the amount of inventory needed to ensure that the demand during the lead time is met. The lead time is 3 weeks, and the weekly demand is 200 bananas with a standard deviation of 50. The total demand during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 200 = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   The safety stock is calculated using the formula for the safety stock in terms of the standard deviation of the demand and the service level. The initial safety stock is the amount of inventory ordered when the inventory drops to 600, which is:\n   \\[\n   1000 - 600 = 400 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   This means that the safety stock of 400 bananas corresponds to the initial service level.\n\n3. **Determine the new safety stock:**\n   When the lot size is cut in half, the new safety stock is the amount of inventory ordered when the inventory drops to:\n   \\[\n   600 - \\frac{500}{2} = 600 - 250 = 350 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   The new safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   500 - 350 = 150 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert the new safety stock to a service level:**\n   The service level is the probability that the demand during the lead time will not exceed the safety stock. The safety stock of 150 bananas corresponds to a certain number of standard deviations from the mean demand of 600 bananas. The number of standard deviations is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{150}{50\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{150}{50 \\times 1.732} \\approx \\frac{150}{256.6} \\approx 0.58\n   \\]\n   Using a standard normal distribution table, we find that a z-score of 0.58 corresponds to a service level of approximately 71.90%.\n\nTherefore, the new customer service level is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{71.90\\%}\n\\]",
            "To determine the new customer service level after the Banana Stand cuts their lot size in half, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial lot size and lead time demand:**\n   - Initial lot size: \\(1000\\) bananas.\n   - Lead time: \\(3\\) weeks.\n   - Weekly demand: \\(200\\) bananas.\n   - Standard deviation of weekly demand: \\(50\\) bananas.\n   - Lead time demand: \\(200 \\text{ bananas/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 600\\) bananas.\n\n2. **Determine the initial safety stock:**\n   - The Banana Stand orders when the inventory drops to \\(600\\) bananas.\n   - Lead time demand is \\(600\\) bananas.\n   - Therefore, the initial safety stock is \\(600 - 600 = 0\\) bananas.\n\n3. **Calculate the initial safety stock in terms of standard deviations:**\n   - Standard deviation of lead time demand: \\(50 \\text{ bananas} \\times \\sqrt{3} = 50 \\times 1.732 = 86.6\\) bananas.\n   - Initial safety stock in standard deviations: \\(\\frac{0}{86.6} = 0\\).\n\n4. **Determine the initial customer service level:**\n   - A safety stock of \\(0\\) standard deviations corresponds to a customer service level of \\(50\\%\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the new lot size:**\n   - New lot size: \\(\\frac{1000}{2} = 500\\) bananas.\n\n6. **Determine the new lead time demand:**\n   - Lead time demand remains \\(600\\) bananas.\n\n7. **Calculate the new safety stock:**\n   - New safety stock: \\(600 - 500 = 100\\) bananas.\n\n8. **Calculate the new safety stock in terms of standard deviations:**\n   - New safety stock in standard deviations: \\(\\frac{100}{86.6} \\approx 1.1547\\).\n\n9. **Determine the new customer service level:**\n   - A safety stock of \\(1.1547\\) standard deviations corresponds to a customer service level of approximately \\(87.5\\%\\).\n\nTherefore, the new customer service level is \\(\\boxed{87.5\\%}\\).",
            "To determine the new customer service level after the Banana Stand cuts their lot size in half, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the original safety stock:**\n   - Weekly demand is 200 bananas.\n   - Replenishment lead time is 3 weeks.\n   - Standard deviation of weekly demand is 50 bananas.\n   - The manager orders 1000 bananas when the inventory drops to 600.\n   - Therefore, the initial safety stock is \\(1000 - (3 \\times 200) = 1000 - 600 = 400\\) bananas.\n\n2. **Calculate the original service level:**\n   - The safety stock of 400 bananas corresponds to a certain number of standard deviations from the mean.\n   - The mean demand over 3 weeks is \\(3 \\times 200 = 600\\) bananas.\n   - The standard deviation of demand over 3 weeks is \\(\\sqrt{3} \\times 50 \\approx 86.60\\) bananas.\n   - The z-score for the safety stock is \\(\\frac{400 - 600}{86.60} \\approx -2.31\\).\n   - Using a standard normal distribution table, the probability corresponding to a z-score of -2.31 is approximately 0.0104.\n   - Therefore, the original service level is \\(1 - 0.0104 = 0.9896\\) or 98.96%.\n\n3. **Calculate the new lot size:**\n   - The new lot size is half of the original lot size, which is \\(\\frac{1000}{2} = 500\\) bananas.\n\n4. **Calculate the new safety stock:**\n   - The new initial safety stock is \\(500 - (3 \\times 200) = 500 - 600 = -100\\). Since the safety stock cannot be negative, the manager will need to order more bananas when the inventory drops to 500 - 0 = 500.\n   - However, this calculation is incorrect. The safety stock should be recalculated based on the new order point and lead time.\n   - The new order point should be \\(1000 - (3 \\times 200) = 1000 - 600 = 500\\) (\"is correct:disable Laden BTN

The tablet supplier takes an average of $L=7$ days to replenish inventory at Amazon. Amazon is targeting a CSL of 90 percent (providing a fill rate close to 100 percent) for its tablet inventory.

            "To determine the safety inventory of tablets that Amazon must carry, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the lead time demand:**\n   The lead time demand is the total number of tablets required during the lead time. Since the daily demand is normally distributed with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 500, and the lead time is 7 days, the lead time demand is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Lead time demand} = \\text{Mean daily demand} \\times \\text{ lead time} = 2500 \\times 7 = 17500\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the standard deviation of the lead time demand:**\n   The standard deviation of the lead time demand is calculated by multiplying the standard deviation of the daily demand by the square root of the lead time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Standard deviation of lead time demand} = \\text{Standard deviation of daily demand} \\times \\sqrt{\\text{ lead time}} = 500 \\times \\sqrt{7}\n   \\]\n   Using the approximation \\(\\sqrt{7} \\approx 2.64575\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Standard deviation of lead time demand} \\approx 500 \\times 2.64575 = 1322.875\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the z-score corresponding to the target CSL:**\n   The target CSL is 90%, which corresponds to a fill rate of 90%. The z-score for a 90% fill rate is the value of z such that the area under the standard normal curve to the left of z is 0.90. From standard normal distribution tables, we find that:\n   \\[\n   z \\approx 1.28\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is given by the z-score multiplied by the standard deviation of the lead time demand:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = z \\times \\text{Standard deviation of lead time demand} = 1.28 \\times 1322.875 \\approx 1690\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the safety inventory of tablets that Amazon must carry is \\(\\boxed{1690}\\).",

The z-score for a service level of 90 percent is found using the standard normal distribution table. The z-score for a cumulative probability of 0.90 is approximately 1.28.\n\n4. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock \\( S \\) is given by the z-score multiplied by the standard deviation of the lead time demand:\n   \\[\n   S = z \\times \\sigma_{D_L} = 1.28 \\times 1322.875 \\approx 1691.92\n   \\]\n   Rounding to the nearest whole number, the safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   S \\approx 1692\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the safety inventory of tablets that Amazon must carry is \\(\\boxed{1692}\\).",

Therefore, the average demand over the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average demand over lead time} = 200 \\times 3 = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is the difference between the target inventory and the average demand over the lead time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = 600 - 600 = 0 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the probability of understocking:**\n   Since the safety stock is 0, the probability of understocking is the probability that the inventory level drops below 0 before it is replenished. This is equivalent to the probability that the demand over the lead time exceeds the initial inventory level.\n\n   The initial inventory level is 500 bananas, and the average demand over the lead time is 600 bananas.

The expected number of understocked bananas is the difference between the expected demand and the total inventory after the order is placed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected understocked bananas} = \\text{Expected demand in lead time} - \\text{Total inventory after order} = 600 - (513.40 + 500) = -113.40\n   \\]\n\n   This calculation is incorrect.

Therefore, the annual holding cost per box is:\n\n\\[\nH = 0.25 \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/box} = 0.50 \\text{ dollars/box}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the EOQ formula:\n\n\\[\nEOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 52000 \\text{ boxes/year} \\times 200 \\text{ dollars/order}}{0.50 \\text{ dollars/box}}}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 52000 \\times 200 = 20800000 \\text{ box-dollars/year}\n\\]\n\nNext, divide the numerator by the holding cost per box:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20800000 \\text{ box-dollars/year}}{0.50 \\text{ dollars/box}} = 41600000 \\text{ boxes}^2\n\\]\n\nFinally, take the square root of the result:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{41600000} = 6450 \\text{ boxes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the optimal order quantity for Dominick's is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6450}\n\\]",
