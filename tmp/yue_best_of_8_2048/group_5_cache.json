            "To determine the safety inventory of smartphones that Cromma should carry at each retail store, we need to calculate the safety stock based on the desired service level (CSL) and the lead time for replenishment orders. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the lead time demand:**\n   The lead time for replenishment orders is 4 weeks. Since the weekly demand for smartphones at each store is normally distributed with a mean of 300 and a standard deviation of 300, the lead time demand (L) is also normally distributed with:\n   \\[\n   \\mu_L = 4 \\times 300 = 1200\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_L = \\sqrt{4} \\times 300 = 2 \\times 300 = 600\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the z-score for the desired service level:**\n   The desired service level (CSL) is 95%. We need to find the z-score corresponding to the 95th percentile of the standard normal distribution. From standard normal distribution tables or using a calculator, we find:\n   \\[\n   z = 1.645\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock (SS) is given by the z-score multiplied by the standard deviation of the lead time demand:\n   \\[\n   SS = z \\times \\sigma_L = 1.645 \\times 600 = 987\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the safety inventory of smartphones that Cromma should carry at each retail store is \\boxed{987}.",

            "To determine the change in fill rate if DoorRed pharmacy increases its ROP from 750 to 800, we need to calculate the probability of a stockout for both ROP levels and then find the difference between these probabilities.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- \\( \\mu = 300 \\) (mean daily demand)\n- \\( \\sigma = 100 \\) (standard deviation of daily demand)\n- \\( ROP_1 = 750 \\) (initial ROP)\n- \\( ROP_2 = 800 \\) (new ROP)\n- \\( T = 2 \\) days ( lead time)\n\nThe stockout probability is the probability that the total demand over the lead time exceeds the ROP.

Therefore, the expected number of company deliveries per day is 80.\n\n2. **Determine the maximum number of individual deliveries possible:**\n   The total number of deliveries (both companies and individuals) that can be made in a day is 110. If the expected number of company deliveries is 80, then the maximum number of individual deliveries possible is:\n   \\[\n   110 - 80 = 30\n   \\]\n   However, since individual demand is plentiful, we need to consider the probability that the number of company deliveries will exceed the capacity of the landfill.

The current policy is to order 200 bottles when the quantity on hand drops below 45 bottles. The lead time is one day, so we need to consider the demand over the next two days (one day to receive the order and one day to use the order).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected demand over two days. Since the daily demand is normally distributed with a mean of 40 bottles and a standard deviation of 5 bottles, the expected demand over two days is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 40 = 80 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the probability that the demand over two days will exceed 145 bottles (since the pharmacy has 45 bottles in stock when they order, they will stock out if the demand over the next two days is more than 145 bottles). The demand over two days is also normally distributed with a mean of 80 bottles and a standard deviation of:\n\\[ \\sqrt{2} \\times 5 = 5\\sqrt{2} \\approx 7.07 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nWe need to find the probability that the demand over two days is more than 145 bottles.

Therefore, the probability that the pharmacy will stock out is approximately 0. This means that the expected cost of stocking out per year is:\n\\[ 0 \\times \\text{cost per stockout} = 0 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected cost of holding inventory per year. The holding cost per bottle per year is 25% of the cost of each bottle, which is:\n\\[ 0.25 \\times 4 = 1 \\text{ dollar per bottle per year} \\]\n\nThe average inventory level is the average of the minimum inventory level (45 bottles) and the maximum inventory level (200 bottles) minus the expected demand over one day (40 bottles).

The inventory policy is to order 200 bottles when the quantity on hand drops below 45. This means that if the inventory level reaches 45, it will be immediately replenished to 200. The expected number of bottles held in inventory is the average of the minimum inventory level (45) and the maximum inventory level (200), minus the expected number of bottles sold during the lead time.\n\nThe expected number of bottles sold during the lead time is:\n\\[ \\mu L = 40 \\times 1 = 40 \\]\n\nThe expected number of bottles held in inventory is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected inventory} = \\frac{45 + (200 - 40)}{2} = \\frac{45 + 160}{2} = \\frac{205}{2} = 102.5 \\]\n\nThe annual holding cost is:\n\\[ \\text{Annual holding cost} = 102.5 \\times 365 \\times \\frac{1}{365} = 102.5 \\text{ dollars per year} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the expected number of bottles short per year. The probability that the inventory level will drop below 45 is the probability that the daily demand will be greater than 45. This probability can be calculated using the standard normal distribution.\n\nThe z-score for 45 is:\n\\[ z = \\frac{45 - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{45 - 40}{5} = 1 \\]\n\nThe probability that the daily demand will be greater than 45 is:\n\\[ P(Z > 1) = 1 - P(Z \\leq 1) \\]\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table, we find that:\n\\[ P(Z \\leq 1) = 0.8413 \\]\n\\[ P(Z > 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 \\]\n\nThe expected number of bottles short per day is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected short per day} = \\mu P(Z > 1) = 40 \\times 0.1587 = 6.348 \\]\n\nThe expected number of bottles short per year is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected short per year} = 6.348 \\times 365 = 2318.22 \\]\n\nThe cost of stocking out per year is:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of stocking out} = 2318.22 \\times C = 2318.22 \\times 4 = 9272.88 \\text{ dollars per year} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of stocking out that justifies the current policy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{9273} \\]",

We will then compare this total cost to the total cost of holding inventory and stockouts for the optimal policy.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the holding cost for the current policy. The holding cost is 25% of the value of the inventory. The value of the inventory is the average number of bottles held times the cost per bottle.\n\nThe average number of bottles held under the current policy can be calculated using the following formula for the average inventory under a base-case policy:\n\\[ \\text{Average inventory} = \\frac{Q}{2} + \\text{\u5b89\u5168 stock} \\]\nwhere \\( Q \\) is the order quantity and the safety stock is the inventory level at which an order is placed.

The stockout cost is the cost of the unfilled demand. The unfilled demand occurs when the demand exceeds the safety stock. The safety stock is 5 bottles, so we need to find the probability that the demand on any given day is greater than 5 bottles.\n\nThe demand is normally distributed with a mean of 40 and a standard deviation of 5. We need to find the probability that the demand is greater than 40 - 5 = 35 bottles. This is equivalent to finding the probability that the demand is greater than the mean minus one standard deviation. Using the standard normal distribution table, we find that the probability that a standard normal variable is less than -1 is 0.1587. Therefore, the probability that the demand is greater than 40 - 5 is:\n\\[ P(\\text{demand} > 35) = 0.8413 \\]\n\nThe expected number of bottles lost per day is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected number of bottles lost per day} = (45 - 40) \\times P(\\text{demand} > 40 - 5) = 5 \\times 0.1587 = 0.7935 \\]\n\nThe stockout cost per day is:\n\\[ \\text{Stockout cost per day} = 0.7935 \\times 4 = 3.174 \\]\n\nThe stockout cost per year is:\n\\[ \\text{Stockout cost per year} = 3.174 \\times 365 = 1158.39 \\]\n\nThe total cost of holding inventory and stockouts for the current policy is:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Holding cost} + \\text{Stockout cost per year} = 105 + 1158.39 = 1263.39 \\]\n\nTo find the optimal policy, we need to find the safety stock that minimizes the total cost. The optimal safety stock can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Optimal safety stock} = z \\times \\sigma \\]\nwhere \\( z \\) is the z-score corresponding to the service level and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of the demand. The service level is the probability that the demand does not exceed the safety stock.\n\nThe service level is the same as the probability that the demand is less than or equal to the safety stock. Let \\( S \\) be the safety stock. Then:\n\\[ S = \\mu + z \\sigma \\]\nwhere \\( \\mu \\) is the mean of the demand.\n\nThe holding cost per year for the optimal policy is:\n\\[ \\text{Holding cost} = \\left( \\frac{Q}{2} + S - \\mu \\right) \\times C \\times H = \\left( \\frac{Q}{2} + z \\sigma - \\mu \\right) \\times C \\times H \\]\n\nThe stockout cost per year for the optimal policy is:\n\\[ \\text{Stockout cost} = \\int_{S}^{\\infty} (S - \\mu) f(x) \\, dx \\]\n\nThe total cost of holding inventory and stockouts for the optimal policy is:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\left( \\frac{Q}{2} + z \\sigma - \\mu \\right) \\times C \\times H + \\int_{S}^{\\infty} (S - \\mu) f(x) \\, dx \\]\n\nBy trial and error or using numerical methods, we find that the optimal safety stock is approximately 43.5. The corresponding order quantity is:\n\\[ Q = 2 \\times (43.5 - 40) + 200 = 2 \\times 3.5 + 200 = 207 \\]\n\nThe holding cost per year for the optimal policy is:\n\\[ \\text{Holding cost} = \\left( \\frac{207}{2} + 43.5 - 40 \\right) \\times 4 \\times 0.25 = \\left( 103.5 + 3.5 \\right) \\times 1 = 107 \\]\n\nThe stockout cost per year for the optimal policy is:\n\\[ \\text{Stockout cost} = \\int_{43.5}^{\\infty} (x - 40) f(x) \\, dx \\approx 1.44 \\]\n\nThe total cost of holding inventory and stockouts for the optimal policy is:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 107 + 1.44 = 108.44 \\]\n\nThe cost of stocking out justifies the current policy if the total cost of the current policy is less than or equal to the total cost of the optimal policy.

            "To determine the cost of stocking out justifies the current policy, we need to calculate the total cost of holding inventory and the total cost of stockouts. The total cost is the sum of these two costs.

For simplicity, we will focus on the holding cost and stockout cost.\n\n2. **Determine the safety stock (SS):**\n\n   The safety stock is the amount of inventory needed to cover the demand during the lead time with a certain service level. The lead time is 1 day, so the demand during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   D_{\\text{ lead time}} = 40 \\text{ bottles/day} \\times 1 \\text{ day} = 40 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\n   The service level is determined by the inventory policy.

            "To determine the customer service level, we need to calculate the probability that the inventory will not run out during the lead time. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 3 weeks, and the weekly demand is 200 bananas with a standard deviation of 50. Therefore, the total demand \\( D \\) during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   D = 200 \\times 3 = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   The standard deviation of the total demand \\( \\sigma_D \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_D = 50 \\times \\sqrt{3} \\approx 86.60 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory and the order quantity:**\n   The initial inventory is 600 bananas, and the order quantity is 1000 bananas. Therefore, the total available inventory \\( I \\) after placing the order is:\n   \\[\n   I = 600 + 1000 = 1600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the probability of a stockout:**\n   A stockout occurs if the total demand \\( D \\) exceeds the initial inventory \\( I \\) minus the lead time demand. However, since the initial inventory is equal to the lead time demand, a stockout will only occur if the total demand exceeds 600 bananas. We need to find the probability that the total demand \\( D \\) is less than or equal to 600 bananas:\n   \\[\n   P(D \\leq 600) = P\\left( \\frac{D - 600}{86.60} \\leq \\frac{600 - 600}{86.60} \\right) = P\\left( Z \\leq 0 \\right)\n   \\]\n   where \\( Z \\) is a standard normal random variable. From the standard normal distribution table, we know that:\n   \\[\n   P(Z \\leq 0) = 0.5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the customer service level:**\n   The customer service level is the probability that the inventory will not run out during the lead time, which is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Customer service level} = 1 - P(\\text{stockout}) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n   \\]\n   Converting this to a percentage, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Customer service level} = 0.5 \\times 100 = 50\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer service level is \\(\\boxed{50\\%}\\).",
            "To determine the customer service level, we need to calculate the probability that the inventory will not run out before the next replenishment arrives. Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 3 weeks, and the weekly demand is 200 bananas with a standard deviation of 50. Therefore, the total demand during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total demand} = 200 \\text{ bananas/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   The standard deviation of the total demand over 3 weeks is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Standard deviation of total demand} = \\sqrt{3} \\times 50 \\approx 86.60 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory and the order quantity:**\n   The initial inventory when the order is placed is 600 bananas, and the order quantity is 1000 bananas. Therefore, the total inventory immediately after the order is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total inventory} = 600 \\text{ bananas} + 1000 \\text{ bananas} = 1600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the target inventory:**\n   The target inventory is the point at which the manager will place another order. This is when the inventory drops to 600 bananas. Therefore, the target inventory is 600 bananas.\n\n4. **Determine the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is the difference between the initial inventory and the target inventory:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = 1600 \\text{ bananas} - 600 \\text{ bananas} = 1000 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   However, we need to find the safety stock in terms of the lead time demand. The safety stock should be such that the probability of not running out during the lead time is the customer service level. Let \\( z \\) be the z-score corresponding to the customer service level. Then:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = z \\times \\text{Standard deviation of total demand} = z \\times 86.60\n   \\]\n   The safety stock should be equal to the lead time demand minus the initial inventory when the order is placed:\n   \\[\n   z \\times 86.60 = 1000 \\text{ bananas} - 600 \\text{ bananas} = 400 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{400}{86.60} \\approx 4.58\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find the customer service level:**\n   The z-score of 4.58 corresponds to a cumulative probability of approximately 0.9999.

The total demand \\( D \\) during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   D = 200 \\times 3 = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   The standard deviation of the total demand \\( \\sigma_D \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_D = \\sqrt{3} \\times 50 = 50\\sqrt{3} \\approx 86.60 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory and the re order point:**\n   The initial inventory when the order is placed is 1000 bananas, and the re order point is 600 bananas. Therefore, the safety stock \\( S \\) is:\n   \\[\n   S = 1000 - 600 = 400 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the z-score:**\n   The z-score is the number of standard deviations the safety stock is above the mean demand. It is given by:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{S - D}{\\sigma_D} = \\frac{400 - 600}{86.60} = \\frac{-200}{86.60} \\approx -2.29\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the probability corresponding to the z-score:**\n   Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find the probability that a standard normal random variable is less than -2.29. This probability is approximately 0.0107. Since we are interested in the probability that the inventory will not run out, we need the probability that a standard normal random variable is greater than -2.29, which is:\n   \\[\n   P(Z > -2.29) = 1 - P(Z < -2.29) = 1 - 0.0107 = 0.9893\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer service level is \\(\\boxed{0.99}\\).",

            "To determine the optimal number of company dump trucks to admit each day, we need to balance the number of company and individual deliveries to maximize revenue while ensuring that the total number of deliveries does not exceed 110.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( C \\) as the number of company dump trucks admitted each day.\n- \\( I \\) as the number of individual dump trucks admitted each day.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. The average number of companies tipping their trucks each day is 80 with a standard deviation of 15.\n2. The total number of deliveries (companies and individuals) cannot exceed 110.\n3. The revenue from each company dump truck is \\$150, and the revenue from each individual dump truck is \\$40.\n\nThe constraint on the total number of deliveries can be expressed as:\n\\[ C + I \\leq 110 \\]\n\nSince the average number of companies tipping their trucks each day is 80, we can use this information to estimate the number of companies that will actually tip their trucks each day. However, due to the standard deviation, the actual number of companies tipping their trucks each day can vary. To be conservative, we should consider the worst-case scenario where the number of companies tipping their trucks is at its maximum possible value.\n\nThe maximum number of companies tipping their trucks can be estimated using the properties of the normal distribution. Specifically, we can use the 99th percentile to account for the variability. The z-score corresponding to the 99th percentile is approximately 2.33. Therefore, the maximum number of companies tipping their trucks can be calculated as:\n\\[ 80 + 2.33 \\times 15 = 80 + 34.95 = 114.95 \\]\n\nSince the number of companies must be an integer, we round down to 114.

            "To determine how much Tastee Mart should order given the short-term price reduction, we need to calculate the total cost of ordering and holding inventory under the new price. The total cost includes the cost of the Frostee Flakes, the holding cost, and the fixed cost of placing an order.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the Frostee Flakes per box after the price reduction:\n\\[ \\$1.80 \\text{ per box} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the optimal order quantity that minimizes the total cost. The total cost \\( C \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ C = \\text{Cost of Frostee Flakes} + \\text{Holding Cost} + \\text{Fixed Cost} \\]\n\\[ C = 500 \\times 1.80 + \\frac{Q}{2} \\times 0.30 \\times 2 + 100 \\]\n\\[ C = 900 + 0.15Q + 100 \\]\n\\[ C = 1000 + 0.15Q \\]\n\nTo minimize the total cost, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that minimizes this expression. However, since the holding cost and fixed cost are linear with respect to \\( Q \\), we can use the economic order quantity (EOQ) formula to find the optimal order quantity under the original conditions and then check if the same quantity is still optimal under the new price.\n\nThe EOQ formula is:\n\\[ Q = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times \\text{Annual Demand} \\times \\text{Fixed Cost}}{\\text{Holding Cost per Box}}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to convert the weekly demand to annual demand:\n\\[ \\text{Annual Demand} = 500 \\times 52 = 26000 \\text{ boxes} \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the EOQ formula:\n\\[ Q = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 26000 \\times 100}{0.30 \\times 2}} \\]\n\\[ Q = \\sqrt{\\frac{5200000}{0.60}} \\]\n\\[ Q = \\sqrt{8666666.67} \\]\n\\[ Q \\approx 2944 \\text{ boxes} \\]\n\nSince Tastee Mart cannot order a fraction of a box, we round to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the optimal order quantity under the original conditions is approximately 2944 boxes. However, we need to check if this quantity is still optimal under the new price.\n\nGiven that the holding cost and fixed cost remain the same, and the cost of the Frostee Flakes per box has decreased, it is likely that the optimal order quantity will increase. However, since the problem does not specify any constraints on the order quantity, we can assume that Tastee Mart will order as much as possible to take advantage of the price reduction.\n\nGiven the problem constraints, the most logical order quantity is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\] boxes. This is the quantity that minimizes the total cost under the given constraints. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\] boxes.",
            "To determine the optimal order quantity for Tastee Mart given the short-term price reduction, we need to calculate the total cost of ordering and holding the Frostee Flakes for a month and then find the order quantity that minimizes this cost. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the monthly demand:**\n   The demand for Frostee Flakes is 500 boxes per week. Therefore, the monthly demand is:\n   \\[\n   500 \\text{ boxes/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 2000 \\text{ boxes/month}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the cost per box after the trade promotion:**\n   The original price per box is \\$2, and the trade promotion lowers the price to \\$1.80 per box.\n\n3. **Calculate the holding cost per box per month:**\n   The holding cost is 30 percent of the cost per box. Therefore, the holding cost per box per month is:\n   \\[\n   0.30 \\times 2.00 = 0.60 \\text{ dollars/box/month}\n   \\]\n   Since the price reduction is only for a month, the holding cost per box per month will be different from the holding cost per box per year. However, for the purpose of this calculation, we will use the holding cost per box per month.\n\n4. **Determine the total cost of ordering and holding the Frostee Flakes:**\n   The total cost consists of the ordering cost and the holding cost. The ordering cost is a fixed cost of \\$100 for each order, and the holding cost is the holding cost per box per month multiplied by the average number of boxes held in inventory. If Tastee Mart orders \\( Q \\) boxes, the average number of boxes held in inventory is \\( \\frac{Q}{2} \\). Therefore, the holding cost per order is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{Q}{2} \\times 0.60 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{Q}{2} \\times 0.15 = 0.15Q\n   \\]\n   The total holding cost for the month is:\n   \\[\n   2000 \\times \\frac{Q}{2000} \\times 0.60 = 2000 \\times 0.30 = 600 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   The total cost of ordering and holding the Frostee Flakes is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Ordering Cost} + \\text{Holding Cost} = 100 \\times \\frac{2000}{Q} + 0.60 \\times \\frac{Q}{2} + 600\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find the order quantity that minimizes the total cost:**\n   To minimize the total cost, we take the derivative of the total cost function with respect to \\( Q \\) and set it to zero:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dQ} \\left( 100 \\times \\frac{2000}{Q} + 0.30Q + 600 \\right) = -200000 \\times \\frac{1}{Q^2} + 0.60 = 0\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( Q \\):\n   \\[\n   200000 \\times \\frac{1}{Q^2} = 0.60\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Q^2 = \\frac{200000}{0.60} = 333333.33\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Q = \\sqrt{333333.33} \\approx 577.4\n   \\]\n   Since \\( Q \\) must be a whole number, we round 577.4 to the nearest whole number, which is 577.\n\nTherefore, Tastee Mart should order \\(\\boxed{600}\\) boxes of Frostee Flakes given the short-term price reduction.",
            "To determine how much Tastee Mart should order given the short-term price reduction, we need to calculate the optimal order quantity using the economic order quantity (EOQ) formula. The EOQ formula is given by:\n\n\\[ EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times D \\times S}{H}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( D \\) is the annual demand,\n- \\( S \\) is the fixed cost per order,\n- \\( H \\) is the annual holding cost per unit.\n\nFirst, let's convert the weekly demand to annual demand.

The holding cost per box \\( H \\) is 30% of the cost of each box. Given the short-term price reduction to \\$1.80 per box, the holding cost per box is:\n\n\\[ H = 0.30 \\times 1.80 = 0.54 \\text{ dollars/box} \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the EOQ formula:\n\n\\[ EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 26000 \\times 100}{0.54}} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 26000 \\times 100 = 5200000 \\]\n\nNext, divide the numerator by the holding cost:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5200000}{0.54} \\approx 9629629.63 \\]\n\nThen, take the square root of the result:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{9629629.63} \\approx 3103.16 \\]\n\nSince the order quantity must be a whole number, we round 3103.16 to the nearest whole number, which is 3103.

Therefore, the expected number of diploma covers needed is 850.\n\n2. **Determine the cost of ordering different quantities of diploma covers:**\n   - Each box contains 144 diploma covers and costs \\$2,000.\n   - Each additional diploma cover costs \\$15.\n\n   We need to find the number of boxes \\( x \\) such that the total cost is minimized while meeting the expected demand.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost for different numbers of boxes:**\n   - If \\( x \\) boxes are ordered, the total number of diploma covers received is \\( 144x \\).\n   - If \\( 144x \\) is less than 850, the number of additional diploma covers needed is \\( 850 - 144x \\).\n   - The total cost \\( C \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     C = 2000x + 15(850 - 144x)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying the expression:\n     \\[\n     C = 2000x + 12750 - 2160x = -160x + 12750\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the minimum number of boxes needed:**\n   Since each box contains 144 diploma covers, we need to find the smallest integer \\( x \\) such that \\( 144x \\geq 850 \\).\n   \\[\n   x \\geq \\frac{850}{144} \\approx 5.89\n   \\]\n   Since \\( x \\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:\n   \\[\n   x = 6\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total cost for 6 boxes:**\n   If 6 boxes are ordered, the total number of diploma covers received is:\n   \\[\n   144 \\times 6 = 864\n   \\]\n   Since 864 is greater than 850, no additional diploma covers are needed.\n   The total cost is:\n   \\[\n   C = 2000 \\times 6 = 12000\n   \\]\n\n6. **Verify that ordering 5 boxes is not sufficient:**\n   If 5 boxes are ordered, the total number of diploma covers received is:\n   \\[\n   144 \\times 5 = 720\n   \\]\n   Since 720 is less than 850, additional diploma covers are needed.\n   The number of additional diploma covers needed is:\n   \\[\n   850 - 720 = 130\n   \\]\n   The total cost is:\n   \\[\n   C = 2000 \\times 5 + 15 \\times 130 = 10000 + 1950 = 11950\n   \\]\n   However, ordering 6 boxes is still cheaper than ordering only 5 boxes.\n\nTherefore, the number of boxes of diploma covers that should be ordered from the bookstore is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
            "To determine how many boxes of diploma covers should be ordered from the bookstore, we need to consider the average number of students attending commencement and the standard deviation to ensure we have enough covers for all students. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of students needed:**\n   - The average number of students is 850.\n   - To be certain, we should consider the worst-case scenario, which is the average plus a few standard deviations. A common approach is to consider the average plus 2 standard deviations, which covers about 95% of the students.\n   - The standard deviation is 70.\n   - Therefore, the number of students needed is \\(850 + 2 \\times 70 = 850 + 140 = 990\\).\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed:**\n   - Each box contains 144 diploma covers.\n   - To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the total number of students by the number of covers per box and round up to the next whole number because we can't order a fraction of a box.\n   - \\( \\frac{990}{144} \\approx 6.875 \\).\n   - Rounding up, we get 7 boxes.\n\n3. **Verify the cost:**\n   - If we order 7 boxes, we get \\(7 \\times 144 = 1008\\) covers.\n   - This is more than enough for 990 students.\n   - The cost for 7 boxes is \\(7 \\times 2000 = 14000\\) dollars.\n   - If we order only 6 boxes, we get \\(6 \\times 144 = 864\\) covers.\n   - This is not enough for 990 students.\n   - The cost for 6 boxes is \\(6 \\times 2000 = 12000\\) dollars, but we would need to buy additional covers on the black market.\n   - The number of additional covers needed is \\(990 - 864 = 126\\).\n   - The cost for 126 additional covers is \\(126 \\times 15 = 1890\\) dollars.\n   - The total cost for 6 boxes and additional covers is \\(12000 + 1890 = 13890\\) dollars, which is more expensive than ordering 7 boxes.\n\nTherefore, the number of boxes of diploma covers that should be ordered from the bookstore is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
