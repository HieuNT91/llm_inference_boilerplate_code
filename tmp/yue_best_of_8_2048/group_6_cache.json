\\sqrt{7} \\) back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   S = 1.28 \\times 500 \\times 2.64575 \\approx 1.28 \\times 1,322.875 = 1,691.36 \\text{ tablets}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the safety inventory if the standard deviation of lead time is reduced to zero:**\n   If the standard deviation of lead time \\( \\sigma_L \\) is zero, the safety inventory formula simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   S = D \\times (1 - \\text{CSL})\n   \\]\n\n   First, convert the cycle service level to a decimal:\n   \\[\n   \\text{CSL} = 0.90\n   \\]\n\n   Now, calculate \\( 1 - \\text{CSL} \\):\n   \\[\n   1 - 0.90 = 0.10\n   \\]\n\n   Next, calculate the safety inventory:\n   \\[\n   S = 17,500 \\times 0.10 = 1,750 \\text{ tablets}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the reduction in safety inventory:**\n   Subtract the safety inventory with zero standard deviation from the current safety inventory:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Reduction} = 1,691.36 - 1,750 = -68.64\n   \\]\n\n   Since the result is negative, it indicates that there is no reduction in safety inventory. instead, the safety inventory with zero standard deviation is actually higher than the current safety inventory.\n\n   The reduction in safety inventory

The supplier manufactures compact discs at \\$1 per unit and sells them to the music store at \\$5 per unit. The retailer sells each disc to the end consumer at \\$10. At this retail price, market demand is normally distributed, with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 300. Any leftover discs at the end of the sale period are worthless. If the manufacturer and the retailer are vertically integrated (they are a single firm), how many discs should the retailer order?\nassistant\n",

            "To determine how many discs the retailer should order if the manufacturer and the retailer are vertically integrated, we need to consider the entire chain's profit and the costs involved. Since they are a single firm, the profit will be maximized by minimizing the total cost while maximizing the revenue.\n\nLet's denote the number of discs ordered by the retailer as \\( Q \\).\n\n1. **Cost Calculation:**\n   - The cost of manufacturing each disc is \\$1 per unit.\n   - The cost of purchasing each disc from the supplier is \\$5 per unit.\n   - Therefore, the total cost per disc to the retailer is \\( 1 + 5 = 6 \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Revenue Calculation:**\n   - The selling price to the end consumer is \\$10 per unit.\n   - The revenue per disc sold is \\$10.\n\n3. **Profit Calculation:**\n   - The profit per disc sold is \\( 10 - 6 = 4 \\) dollars.\n   - The profit per disc not sold (leftover) is \\( -6 \\) dollars (since it is worth nothing).\n\n4. **Expected Profit Calculation:**\n   - The market demand is normally distributed with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 300.\n   - The expected profit can be calculated using the expected value of the profit function.\n\nThe expected profit \\( E[\\text{Profit}] \\) is given by:\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = 4 \\cdot E[\\text{min}(Q, D)] - 6 \\cdot E[\\max(0, Q - D)] \\]\nwhere \\( D \\) is the random demand.\n\nUsing the properties of the normal distribution, we can find the expected value of the minimum and maximum functions.

            "To determine the optimal number of compact discs the retailer should order if the manufacturer and the retailer are vertically integrated, we need to consider the entire chain's profit and the costs involved.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- \\( C \\) is the cost to the retailer per disc from the manufacturer, which is \\$5.\n- \\( S \\) is the selling price to the consumer, which is \\$10.\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean market demand, which is 1,000.\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of market demand, which is 300.\n- \\( q \\) is the number of discs the retailer orders.\n\nThe profit per disc sold is \\( S - C = 10 - 5 = 5 \\) dollars. The profit per unsold disc is \\( -C = -5 \\) dollars.\n\nThe expected profit \\( E(P) \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ E(P) = 5 \\cdot E(\\text{number of discs sold}) - 5 \\cdot E(\\text{number of discs unsold}) \\]\n\nThe number of discs sold is the minimum of the order quantity \\( q \\) and the market demand \\( D \\). Therefore, the expected number of discs sold is:\n\\[ E(\\text{number of discs sold}) = E(\\min(q, D)) \\]\n\nThe expected number of discs unsold is:\n\\[ E(\\text{number of discs unsold}) = q - E(\\min(q, D)) \\]\n\nUsing the properties of the normal distribution, we can find \\( E(\\min(q, D)) \\). The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution \\( D \\) is denoted by \\( \\Phi \\), and the probability density function (PDF) is denoted by \\( \\phi \\). The expected value \\( E(\\min(q, D)) \\) is given by:\n\\[ E(\\min(q, D)) = \\mu + \\sigma \\phi\\left(\\frac{q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) - q \\Phi\\left(\\frac{q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) \\]\n\nSubstituting the values of \\( \\mu \\) and \\( \\sigma \\):\n\\[ E(\\min(q, D)) = 1000 + 300 \\phi\\left(\\frac{q - 1000}{300}\\right) - q \\Phi\\left(\\frac{q - 1000}{300}\\right) \\]\n\nThe expected profit \\( E(P) \\) then becomes:\n\\[ E(P) = 5 \\left(1000 + 300 \\phi\\left(\\frac{q - 1000}{300}\\right) - q \\Phi\\left(\\frac{q - 1000}{300}\\right)\\right) - 5 (q - 1000 + 300 \\phi\\left(\\frac{q - 1000}{300}\\right) - q \\Phi\\left(\\frac{q - 1000}{300}\\right)) \\]\n\\[ E(P) = 5 \\left(1000 + 300 \\phi\\left(\\frac{q - 1000}{300}\\right) - q \\Phi\\left(\\frac{q - 1000}{300}\\right) - q + 1000 - 300 \\phi\\left(\\frac{q - 1000}{300}\\right) + q \\Phi\\left(\\frac{q - 1000}{300}\\right)\\right) \\]\n\\[ E(P) = 5 \\left(2000 - q\\right) \\]\n\\[ E(P) = 10000 - 5q \\]\n\nTo maximize the expected profit, we take the derivative of \\( E(P) \\) with respect to \\( q \\) and set it to zero:\n\\[ \\frac{dE(P)}{dq} = -5 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the derivative is a constant and negative, the expected profit is a linear function that decreases with \\( q \\). Therefore, the expected profit is maximized when \\( q \\) is as close to the mean market demand as possible without exceeding it. Given that the mean market demand is 1,000, the optimal number of discs the retailer should order is:\n\\[ q = 1000 \\]\n\nThus, the retailer should order \\(\\boxed{1000}\\) discs.",
            "To determine how many compact discs the retailer should order if the manufacturer and the retailer are vertically integrated, we need to consider the entire chain's profit and the cost structure. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the cost and revenue structure:**\n   - The cost to the retailer per disc is \\$5 (from the manufacturer).\n   - The revenue per disc to the retailer is \\$10.\n   - The profit per disc is \\$10 - \\$5 = \\$5.\n\n2. **Understand the demand distribution:**\n   - The market demand is normally distributed with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 300.\n   - We need to find the optimal order quantity that maximizes the expected profit.\n\n3. **Calculate the critical fractile:**\n   - The critical fractile is the probability that the demand will be less than or equal to the order quantity. This is determined by the ratio of the profit per disc to the profit per disc plus the cost of the unsold discs.\n   - Since the unsold discs are worth nothing, the profit per disc for the retailer is \\$5. Therefore, the critical fractile is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Critical fractile} = \\frac{\\text{Profit per disc}}{\\text{Profit per disc} + \\text{Cost per disc}} = \\frac{5}{5 + 5} = 0.5\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the corresponding z-score:**\n   - The critical fractile of 0.5 corresponds to the mean of the normal distribution. Therefore, the z-score is 0.\n\n5. **Calculate the optimal order quantity:**\n   - The optimal order quantity is the mean of the demand distribution, which is 1,000.\n\nThus, if the manufacturer and the retailer are vertically integrated, the retailer should order \\boxed{1000} discs.",

However, this approach is not directly applicable. Instead, we use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution to find the z-score corresponding to the cumulative probability of 0.5 + 0.707 (since \\( C = 2 \\times C

            "To determine the optimal order quantity for English peas, we need to calculate the total cost of holding inventory and the total cost of placing orders.

Let's denote the optimal order quantity by \\( Q \\). The number of orders placed in a year is:\n\\[\n\\frac{229 \\text{ half-cup servings}}{Q}\n\\]\nThe cost of placing an order is \\$3, so the total cost of placing orders is:\n\\[\n3 \\times \\frac{229}{Q}\n\\]\nThe average inventory is:\n\\[\n\\frac{Q}{2}\n\\]\nThe cost of holding inventory is two cents per half-cup serving per year, which is \\$0.02 per half-cup serving per year. Therefore, the total cost of holding inventory is:\n\\[\n0.02 \\times \\frac{Q}{2} \\times 365 = 3.65Q\n\\]\nThe total cost is the sum of the cost of placing orders and the cost of holding inventory:\n\\[\n3 \\times \\frac{229}{Q} + 3.65Q\n\\]\nTo minimize this total cost, we take the derivative with respect to \\( Q \\) and set it equal to zero:\n\\[\n-3 \\times \\frac{229}{Q^2} + 3.65 = 0\n\\]\nSolving for \\( Q \\):\n\\[\n3.65 = 3 \\times \\frac{229}{Q^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n3.65Q^2 = 3 \\times 229\n\\]\n\\[\n3.65Q^2 = 687\n\\]\n\\[\nQ^2 = \\frac{687}{3.65}\n\\]\n\\[\nQ^2 = 188\n\\]\n\\[\nQ = \\sqrt{188} \\approx 13.71\n\\]\nSince \\( Q \\) must be a whole number, we round 13.71 to the nearest whole number, which is 14.

The EOQ formula is given by:\n\n\\[ EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times D \\times S}{H}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( D \\) is the annual demand,\n- \\( S \\) is the cost per order,\n- \\( H \\) is the annual holding cost per unit.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the annual demand for peas. Since 457 patrons order the hearty breakfast each day and each serving contains a half cup of English peas, the daily demand for peas is:\n\n\\[ 457 \\text{ patrons/day} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ cup/patron} = 228.5 \\text{ cups/day} \\]\n\nTo find the annual demand, we multiply the daily demand by the number of days in a year (assuming 365 days):\n\n\\[ D = 228.5 \\text{ cups/day} \\times 365 \\text{ days/year} = 83822.5 \\text{ cups/year} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the annual holding cost from cents to dollars. Since it costs two cents to hold a half cup of peas for a year, the cost to hold one cup of peas for a year is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2 \\text{ cents}}{0.5 \\text{ cup}} = 4 \\text{ cents/cup} = 0.04 \\text{ dollars/cup} \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of \\( D \\), \\( S \\), and \\( H \\) into the EOQ formula:\n\n\\[ EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 83822.5 \\text{ cups/year} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/order}}{0.04 \\text{ dollars/cup}}} \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 83822.5 \\times 3 = 502935 \\]\n\nThen, we divide the numerator by the holding cost:\n\n\\[ \\frac{502935}{0.04} = 12573375 \\]\n\nFinally, we take the square root of the result:\n\n\\[ EOQ = \\sqrt{12573375} \\approx 3546 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nThe optimal order quantity is 3546 cups of peas.

Therefore, the weekly demand for peas is:\n\\[ 457 \\text{ servings/week} \\times 0.5 \\text{ cups/serving} = 228.5 \\text{ cups/week} \\]\nSince there are 52 weeks in a year, the annual demand \\( D \\) is:\n\\[ 228.5 \\text{ cups/week} \\times 52 \\text{ weeks/year} = 11872 \\text{ cups/year} \\]\n\nNext, we know the cost per order \\( C \\) is \\$3, and the annual holding cost per cup \\( H \\) is \\$0.02 per half cup, which is:\n\\[ \\$0.02 \\text{ per half cup} \\times 2 \\text{ half cups/cup} = \\$0.04 \\text{ per cup} \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the EOQ formula:\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 11872 \\text{ cups/year} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/order}}{0.04 \\text{ dollars/cup}}} \\]\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{71232 \\text{ cup-dollars/year}}{0.04 \\text{ dollars/cup}}} \\]\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{1780800 \\text{ cups}} \\]\n\\[ Q^* = 1334.46 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nSince we cannot order a fraction of a cup, we round to the nearest whole number, so the optimal order quantity is 1334 cups.\n\nTo find the average inventory, we need to consider that the inventory level is highest immediately after an order is placed and decreases over time until the next order is placed.

The fixed transportation cost per shipment is \\$5,000, and the variable transportation cost per unit is \\$0.10. The total transportation cost per order is:\n\\[ \\text{Transportation cost per order} = 5,000 + 0.10 \\times 34,641 = 5,000 + 3,464.1 = 8,464.1 \\text{ dollars/order} \\]\n\nThe annual fixed transportation cost is:\n\\[ \\text{Annual fixed transportation cost} = \\text{Number of orders per year} \\times \\text{Fixed transportation cost per shipment} = 70 \\times 5,000 = 350,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the annual fixed transportation cost of the optimal policy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{350000} \\]",

            "To determine the optimal order quantity for Vitaherb at the promotion price, we need to consider the cost savings from the discount and the holding cost. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the annual holding cost per bottle:**\n   The holding cost is 20% of the cost of each bottle. Since the manufacturer charges \\$3 per bottle, the holding cost per bottle is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Holding cost per bottle} = 0.20 \\times 3 = 0.60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total holding cost for the current order quantity:**\n   The current order quantity is \\(Q^* = 6,325\\) bottles. The total holding cost for this order quantity is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total holding cost} = \\text{Holding cost per bottle} \\times Q^* = 0.60 \\times 6,325 = 3,795 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost with the discount:**\n   The discount offered is \\$0.15 per bottle. Let \\(Q\\) be the new order quantity. The cost per bottle with the discount is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discounted cost per bottle} = 3 - 0.15 = 2.85 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   The total cost for \\(Q\\) bottles with the discount is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost with discount} = \\text{Discounted cost per bottle} \\times Q + \\text{Holding cost per bottle} \\times Q = 2.85Q + 0.60Q = 3.45Q\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost without the discount:**\n   The total cost for \\(Q\\) bottles without the discount is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost without discount} = 3Q + 0.60Q = 3.60Q\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the savings from the discount:**\n   The savings from the discount is the difference between the total cost without the discount and the total cost with the discount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Savings from discount} = \\text{Total cost without discount} - \\text{Total cost with discount} = 3.60Q - 3.45Q = 0.15Q\n   \\]\n\n6. **Set up the equation to find the optimal order quantity:**\n   The optimal order quantity \\(Q\\) should minimize the total cost. However, since the savings from the discount is directly proportional to the order quantity, the optimal order quantity will be the same as the current order quantity if the discount does not affect the holding cost significantly. Given that the discount is only \\$0.15 per bottle, it is likely that the optimal order quantity will remain the same.\n\nTherefore, the optimal order quantity for Vitaherb at the promotion price is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6325}\n\\]",
            "To determine how many bottles of Vitaherb DO should order at the promotion price, we need to compare the total cost of ordering different quantities. The total cost includes the cost of the bottles, the holding cost, and the discount.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost without the discount. The cost per bottle is \\$3, and the holding cost per bottle is 20% of \\$3, which is \\$0.60. The annual holding cost for ordering \\( Q \\) bottles is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Holding Cost} = \\frac{Q}{2} \\times 0.60 = 0.30Q \\]\n\nThe annual cost of the bottles is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of Bottles} = 120,000 \\times 3 = 360,000 \\]\n\nThe total cost without the discount is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = 360,000 + 0.30Q + \\frac{360,000}{Q} \\times 0.15Q = 360,000 + 0.30Q + 54,000 = 414,000 + 0.30Q \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the discount. If DO orders \\( Q \\) bottles, the cost per bottle is \\$2.85. The holding cost remains the same, so the total cost with the discount is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost with Discount} = 120,000 \\times 2.85 + 0.30Q + \\frac{120,000}{Q} \\times 0.20Q = 342,000 + 0.30Q + 24,000 = 366,000 + 0.30Q \\]\n\nTo find the optimal order quantity with the discount, we compare the total cost with the discount to the total cost without the discount. Since the holding cost term \\( 0.30Q \\) is the same in both cases, we only need to compare the fixed cost terms:\n\n\\[ 366,000 + 0.30Q < 414,000 + 0.30Q \\]\n\nThis inequality is always true, so the discount will always reduce the total cost. Therefore, DO should order as many bottles as possible to take advantage of the discount. Since there is no upper limit given for the order quantity, the optimal order quantity with the discount is the same as the annual demand, which is 120,000 bottles.\n\nThus, the number of bottles of Vitaherb that DO should order at the promotion price is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120000} \\]",

Since Target sells 200,000 units each month, the annual demand is:\n\\[ D = 200,000 \\times 12 = 2,400,000 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the cost per order \\( C \\). The cost per order includes the clerical costs and the fixed cost per shipment:\n\\[ C = 500 + 5,000 = 5,500 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe annual holding cost per unit is given as 20 percent of the cost of each unit. Since each unit costs \\$10, the annual holding cost per unit is:\n\\[ H = 0.20 \\times 10 = 2 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the EOQ formula:\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 2,400,000 \\times 5,500}{2}} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 2,400,000 \\times 5,500 \\div 2} = \\sqrt{2,400,000 \\times 5,500} = \\sqrt{13,200,000,000} = 114,891 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nTo find the optimal number of orders per year, we divide the annual demand by the optimal order quantity:\n\\[ \\text{Number of orders per year} = \\frac{D}{Q^*} = \\frac{2,400,000}{114,891} \\approx 20.91 \\]\n\nSince the number of orders must be a whole number, we round 20.91 to the nearest whole number, which is 21.

The cost per order includes the clerical costs and the fixed shipping cost, plus the variable shipping cost per unit. The fixed costs are \\$500 for clerical costs and \\$5,000 for shipping, so the total fixed costs per order are:\n\n\\[\n500 + 5000 = 5500 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThe variable shipping cost per unit is \\$0.10, so the total variable shipping cost per order is:\n\n\\[\n0.10 \\times \\text{number of units per order}\n\\]\n\nSince the number of units per order is \\( Q \\), the total variable shipping cost per order is:\n\n\\[\n0.10 \\times Q\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost per order \\( C \\) is:\n\n\\[\nC = 5500 + 0.10Q\n\\]\n\nThe annual holding cost per unit is 20% of the cost of each unit. Since each unit costs \\$10, the annual holding cost per unit is:\n\n\\[\nH = 0.20 \\times 10 = 2 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we substitute \\( D \\), \\( C \\), and \\( H \\) into the EOQ formula:\n\n\\[\nEOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\cdot 2,400,000 \\cdot (5500 + 0.10Q)}{2}}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the expression inside the square root:\n\n\\[\nEOQ = \\sqrt{2,400,000 \\cdot (5500 + 0.10Q)}\n\\]\n\nTo find the optimal order quantity \\( Q \\), we need to solve this equation. However, this equation is not straightforward to solve algebraically. Instead, we can use numerical methods or trial and error to find the value of \\( Q \\) that minimizes the total cost. For simplicity, we can use the fact that the total cost function is convex and the minimum occurs when the derivative of the total cost with respect to \\( Q \\) is zero.\n\nAfter solving the equation using numerical methods or trial and error, we find that the optimal order quantity \\( Q \\) is approximately:\n\n\\[\nQ \\approx 60,000 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of orders per year. The number of orders per year is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of orders per year} = \\frac{D}{Q} = \\frac{2,400,000}{60,000} = 40\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of orders per year that Target places is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{40}\n\\]"

The expected number of units sold is given by the expected value of the minimum of the order quantity \\(Q\\) and the demand \\(D\\).\n\n   \\[\n   E[\\min(Q, D)] = Q \\cdot P(D \\leq Q) + \\int_{Q}^{\\infty} D \\cdot f(D) \\, dD\n   \\]\n\n   For \\(Q = 1000\\), we have:\n\n   \\[\n   P(D \\leq 1000) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{1000 - 1000}{300}\\right) = \\Phi(0) = 0.5\n   \\]\n\n   where \\(\\Phi\\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n\n   The integral part is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\int_{1000}^{\\infty} D \\cdot f(D) \\, dD\n   \\]\n\n   Using the properties of the normal distribution, we can express this integral in terms of the standard normal density function \\(\\phi\\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\int_{1000}^{\\infty} D \\cdot f(D) \\, dD = \\int_{1000}^{\\infty} \\left(1000 + 300z\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{300} \\phi(z) \\, 300 \\, dz\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(1000 + 300z\\right) \\phi(z) \\, dz\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 1000 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\phi(z) \\, dz + 300 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} z \\phi(z) \\, dz\n   \\]\n\n   We know that:\n\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\phi(z) \\, dz = 0.5\n   \\]\n   and\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{\\infty} z \\phi(z) \\, dz = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} z e^{-\\frac{z^2}{2}} \\, dz = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\cdot \\left[-e^{-\\frac{z^2}{2}}\\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\cdot \\left[0 + 1\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore:\n\n   \\[\n   300 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} z \\phi(z) \\, dz = 300 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\approx 300 \\cdot 0.408 = 122.4\n   \\]\n\n   Combining these results:\n\n   \\[\n   E[\\min(1000, D)] = 1000 \\cdot 0.5 + 122.4 = 500 + 122.4 = 622.4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Expected Revenue:**\n   The expected revenue is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Revenue}] = P_r \\cdot E[\\min(Q, D)] = 10 \\cdot 622.4 = 6224\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Expected Cost:**\n   The expected cost consists of the production cost and the salvages (which are zero):\n\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Cost}] = C_m \\cdot Q = 6 \\cdot 1000 = 6000\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Expected Profit:**\n   The expected profit is the expected revenue minus the expected cost:\n\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Profit}] = E[\\text{Revenue}] - E[\\text{Cost}] = 6224 - 6000 = 224\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected profit for the retailer is \\(\\boxed{224}\\).",

The worst-case scenario is when the spot market price per million units is at its average value.\n\nTo minimize the expected total cost, we need to find the value of \\( x \\) that minimizes the total expected cost.
