            "To determine the optimal batch size to produce, we need to calculate the total cost of producing a batch of bread and then compare it to the revenue generated by selling the sandwiches made from that batch. The goal is to find the batch size that maximizes profit.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- \\( B \\) is the batch size in loaves.\n- \\( C_B \\) is the cost of producing a batch of bread.\n- \\( C_H \\) is the holding cost for the bread.\n- \\( C_R \\) is the revenue generated by selling the sandwiches made from the batch.\n- \\( P \\) is the profit from the batch.\n\nThe cost of producing a batch of bread is the sum of the production cost and the holding cost. The production cost is simply the cost of the bread itself, which is \\( B \\times \\$1 = \\$B \\). The holding cost is 80% of the cost of the bread, so it is \\( B \\times \\$1 \\times 0.8 = \\$0.8B \\). Therefore, the total production cost is:\n\\[ C_B = B + 0.8B = 1.8B. \\]\n\nThe holding cost for the bread is the cost of holding the bread over the time it takes to use up the batch. Since Sammy's sells 50 sandwiches per hour and each sandwich uses 2 slices of bread, the rate at which bread is used is \\( 50 \\times 2 = 100 \\) slices per hour. Each loaf contains 20 slices, so the rate at which loaves are used is \\( \\frac{100}{20} = 5 \\) loaves per hour. If the batch size is \\( B \\) loaves, it will take \\( \\frac{B}{5} \\) hours to use up the batch. The holding cost for the bread is therefore:\n\\[ C_H = 0.8B \\times \\frac{B}{5} = 0.16B^2. \\]\n\nThe total cost of producing a batch of bread is the sum of the production cost and the holding cost:\n\\[ C = 1.8B + 0.16B^2. \\]\n\nThe revenue generated by selling the sandwiches made from the batch is the number of sandwiches sold times the price per sandwich. Since each loaf makes 2 sandwiches, a batch of \\( B \\) loaves makes \\( 2B \\) sandwiches. The revenue is therefore:\n\\[ R = 2B \\times \\$12.95 = \\$25.9B. \\]\n\nThe profit from the batch is the revenue minus the total cost:\n\\[ P = 25.9B - (1.8B + 0.16B^2) = 25.9B - 1.8B - 0.16B^2 = 24.1B - 0.16B^2. \\]\n\nTo find the batch size that maximizes the profit, we take the derivative of the profit function with respect to \\( B \\) and set it equal to zero:\n\\[ \\frac{dP}{dB} = 24.1 - 0.32B. \\]\nSetting the derivative equal to zero gives:\n\\[ 24.1 - 0.32B = 0. \\]\nSolving for \\( B \\) gives:\n\\[ 0.32B = 24.1, \\]\n\\[ B = \\frac{24.1}{0.32} = 75.3125. \\]\n\nSince the batch size must be a whole number, we round 75.3125 to the nearest whole number, which is 75. Therefore, the optimal batch size to produce is:\n\\[ \\boxed{75}. \\]",
            "To determine the optimal batch size to produce, we need to calculate the total cost of producing and holding the bread and then compare it to the revenue generated from selling the sandwiches. We will use the economic order quantity (EOQ) formula to find the optimal batch size.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- \\( D \\) = demand rate (number of loaves sold per hour)\n- \\( S \\) = setup cost per batch\n- \\( H \\) = holding cost per loaf per hour\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n- \\( D = 50 \\) loaves per hour\n- \\( S = 3 \\) dollars per batch\n- The holding cost per loaf per hour is 80% of the cost of a loaf, which is \\( 0.8 \\times 1 = 0.8 \\) dollars per loaf per hour.\n\nThe EOQ formula is given by:\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2DS}{H}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula, we get:\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 50 \\times 3}{0.8}} \\]\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{300}{0.8}} \\]\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{375} \\]\n\\[ Q^* \\approx 19.36 \\]\n\nSince the batch size must be a whole number, we need to check the cost for both 19 and 20 loaves to determine which one is optimal.\n\n**Cost for 19 loaves:**\n- Number of batches per day: \\( \\frac{50}{19} \\approx 2.63 \\) batches\n- Since we can't have a fraction of a batch, we round up to 3 batches.\n- Total setup cost: \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\) dollars\n- Total holding cost: The average number of loaves held is \\( \\frac{19}{2} = 9.5 \\) loaves. Therefore, the holding cost is \\( 9.5 \\times 0.8 = 7.6 \\) dollars per hour. Since we are holding the bread for 2 hours (the time it takes to use up the batch), the total holding cost is \\( 7.6 \\times 2 = 15.2 \\) dollars.\n- Total cost: \\( 9 + 15.2 = 24.2 \\) dollars per day.\n\n**Cost for 20 loaves:**\n- Number of batches per day: \\( \\frac{50}{20} = 2.5 \\) batches\n- Since we can't have a fraction of a batch, we round up to 3 batches.\n- Total setup cost: \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\) dollars\n- Total holding cost: The average number of loaves held is \\( \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\) loaves. Therefore, the holding cost is \\( 10 \\times 0.8 = 8 \\) dollars per hour. Since we are holding the bread for 2 hours (the time it takes to use up the batch), the total holding cost is \\( 8 \\times 2 = 16 \\) dollars.\n- Total cost: \\( 9 + 16 = 25 \\) dollars per day.\n\nNow, let's calculate the revenue generated from selling the sandwiches:\n- Revenue per sandwich: \\$12.95\n- Number of sandwiches sold per day: 50\n- Total revenue: \\( 50 \\times 12.95 = 647.5 \\) dollars per day\n\nSince the cost of producing and holding 19 loaves is \\$24.2 per day, and the cost of producing and holding 20 loaves is \\$25 per day, the optimal batch size is the one that minimizes the cost. However, we need to consider the revenue to see if the cost difference is worth it.\n\nThe profit for 19 loaves is:\n\\[ 647.5 - 24.2 \\times 5 = 647.5 - 121 = 526.5 \\text{ dollars per day} \\]\n\nThe profit for 20 loaves is:\n\\[ 647.5 - 25 \\times 5 = 647.5 - 125 = 522.5 \\text{ dollars per day} \\]\n\nSince the profit is higher for 19 loaves, the optimal batch size is:\n\\[

            "To determine the optimal quantity of boxes the professor should bring back home, we need to consider the profit from selling the souvenirs and the cost of unsold souvenirs.

The profit for each box that dries out is \\( C_r - C_a = 80 - 125 = -45 \\).\n\nThe optimal order quantity \\( Q^* \\) is given by the critical fractile formula:\n\\[ Q^* = F^{-1}\\left(\\frac{C_s - C_a}{C_s - C_r}\\right) \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula, we get:\n\\[ Q^* = F^{-1}\\left(\\frac{165}{165 - (-45)}\\right) = F^{-1}\\left(\\frac{165}{210}\\right) = F^{-1}\\left(\\frac{11}{14}\\right) \\]\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( Q^* \\) such that the cumulative probability of demand being less than or equal to \\( Q^* \\) is \\( \\frac{11}{14} \\). Since the demand follows a normal distribution with mean \\( \\mu = 80 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 20 \\), we can standardize \\( Q^* \\) using the z-score formula:\n\\[ z = \\frac{Q^* - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nWe need to find the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of \\( \\frac{11}{14} \\approx 0.7857 \\). Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.7857 is approximately 0.80.\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( Q^* \\):\n\\[ 0.80 = \\frac{Q^* - 80}{20} \\]\n\\[ Q^* - 80 = 0.80 \\times 20 \\]\n\\[ Q^* - 80 = 16 \\]\n\\[ Q^* = 96 \\]\n\nTherefore, the optimal quantity of boxes for the professor to bring back home to sell to his friends is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",

Since the profit from the cereal is not a cost but rather a revenue, it does not affect the total cost calculation directly.\n   - The total cost per month is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{Q}{2} + \\frac{4,000,000}{Q} + \\frac{20,000,000}{Q} = \\frac{Q}{2} + \\frac{24,000,000}{Q}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Minimize the total cost:**\n   - To find the value of \\( Q \\) that minimizes the total cost, we take the derivative of the total cost function with respect to \\( Q \\) and set it to zero.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dQ} \\left( \\frac{Q}{2} + \\frac{24,000,000}{Q} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{24,000,000}{Q^2}\n   \\]\n   Setting the derivative equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{24,000,000}{Q^2} = 0\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( Q^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{24,000,000}{Q^2} \\implies Q^2 = 48,000,000 \\implies Q = \\sqrt{48,000,000} = 6,928.20\n   \\]\n   Since \\( Q \\) must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number, which is \\( Q = 6,928 \\).\n\n7. **Calculate the total cost with \\( Q = 6,928 \\):**\n   - The holding cost is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{6,928}{2} = 3,464\n     \\]\n   - The transportation and loading cost is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{20,000,000}{6,928} \\approx 2,885\n     \\]\n   - The ordering cost is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4,000,000}{6,928} \\approx 577\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total cost is:\n     \\[\n     3,464 + 2,885 + 577 = 6,926\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total cost for the retailer as a result of this policy is \\(\\boxed{6926}\\).",

It has production capacity of 1,500 units per day. Currently, the company sells production capacity for \u20ac12.00 per unit. At this price, all production capacity gets booked about one week in advance. Some customers have said that they would be willing to pay an additional \u20ac6 (\u20ac18 per unit) if Kitchen Trims had capacity available on the last day.

How much production capacity should Kitchen Trims reserve for the last day? \nassistant\n",
        "output": [
            "To determine how much production capacity Kitchen Trims should reserve for the last day, we need to analyze the demand for the high-price segment of the trims. The high-price segment is sold at \u20ac18 per unit, and the demand for this segment is normally distributed with a mean of 375 units and a standard deviation of 100 units, 10 days in advance.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the probability that the demand for the high-price segment will be greater than the production capacity reserved for the last day. Let's denote the production capacity reserved for the last day by \\( Q \\). The probability that the demand \\( D \\) will be greater than \\( Q \\) is given by the standard normal distribution:\n\n\\[ P(D > Q) = 1 - P(D \\leq Q) \\]\n\nThe standard normal variable \\( Z \\) is calculated as:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{D - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\mu = 375 \\) and \\( \\sigma = 100 \\). Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ P(D \\leq Q) = P\\left(Z \\leq \\frac{Q - 375}{100}\\right) \\]\n\nWe want to find \\( Q \\) such that the probability of\u6ee1\u8db3 the demand is maximized. Since Kitchen Trims has a production capacity of 1,500 units per day and currently sells production capacity for \u20ac12.00 per unit, it will sell all its production capacity in one week. This means that the high-price segment will have a remaining capacity of \\( 1500 - 375 = 1125 \\) units if the low-price segment is fully sold out. However, we need to find the optimal \\( Q \\) that maximizes the expected profit.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the profit from selling the high-price segment at \u20ac18 per unit and the profit from selling the low-price segment at \u20ac12 per unit. Let's assume that the low-price segment is sold at a lower price and that the company has a fixed cost for production.\n\nThe expected profit from selling the high-price segment is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Expected profit from high-price segment} = 18 \\times \\min(Q, D) \\]\n\nThe expected profit from selling the low-price segment is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Expected profit from low-price segment} = 12 \\times (1500 - D) \\]\n\nThe total expected profit is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total expected profit} = 18 \\times \\min(Q, D) + 12 \\times (1500 - D) \\]\n\nTo maximize the total expected profit, we need to find \\( Q \\) such that the expected profit is maximized. This can be done by finding the value of \\( Q \\) that minimizes the expected value of the difference between the demand and the production capacity reserved for the last day, which is given by the value at risk (VaR) at a certain level.\n\nThe VaR at a certain level \\( \\alpha \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{VaR}_{\\alpha} = Q - \\mu + \\sigma \\Phi^{-1}(\\alpha) \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\Phi^{-1}(\\alpha) \\) is the inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution function. To maximize the expected profit, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) such that the VaR is minimized. This can be done by setting \\( \\alpha = 0.90 \\), which corresponds to the 90th percentile of the demand distribution.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n\\[ Q = 375 + 100 \\times 1.2816 = 503.16 \\]\n\nSince \\( Q \\) must be an integer, we round up to the nearest integer:\n\n\\[ Q = 504 \\]\n\nTherefore, Kitchen Trims should reserve \\(\\boxed{500}\\) units of production capacity for the last day.",
            "To determine how much production capacity Kitchen Trims should reserve for the last day, we need to consider the demand for the high-price segment and the capacity constraints.\n\n1. **Identify the demand distribution**: The demand for the high-price segment is normally distributed with a mean of 375 units and a standard deviation of 100 units. This means that the demand can be modeled as \\( N(375, 100^2) \\).\n\n2. **Determine the service level**: Since customers who want to buy trims on the last day are willing to pay an additional \u20ac6, they will only buy trims if they are available. Therefore, Kitchen Trims should reserve enough capacity to meet the demand of the high-price segment with a high probability. A common service level in such situations is 95%, which corresponds to a z-score of approximately 1.645 (from the standard normal distribution table).\n\n3. **Calculate the required production capacity**: The required production capacity can be found using the formula for the z-score of a normal distribution:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n   \\]\n   where \\( x \\) is the required production capacity, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean demand, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of the demand. Rearranging the formula to solve for \\( x \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   x = \\mu + z \\sigma\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values (\\( \\mu = 375 \\), \\( \\sigma = 100 \\), and \\( z = 1.645 \\)):\n   \\[\n   x = 375 + 1.645 \\times 100 = 375 + 164.5 = 539.5\n   \\]\n   Since production capacity must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number, which is 540.\n\n4. **Consider the total production capacity**: Kitchen Trims has a total production capacity of 1,500 units per day. If they book production capacity for one week in advance, they will have already produced:\n   \\[\n   1500 \\times 7 = 10500 \\text{ units}\n   \\]\n   Since they have already booked all production capacity for one week, they have 1500 units left to produce on the last day. Therefore, they should reserve:\n   \\[\n   540 - 0 = 540 - 1500 + 1500 = 1500 + 539\n  \n\n   units available on the last day.\n\n     units of capacity for the last day.\n\n     ste

            "To determine how much production capacity Kitchen Trims should reserve for the last day, we need to consider the demand for the high-price segment of trims 10 days in advance. The demand is normally distributed with a mean of 375 units and a standard deviation of 100 units.\n\nFirst, let's define the problem in terms of the standard normal distribution. We need to find the probability that the demand will be greater than or equal to the production capacity reserved for the last day. Let's denote the production capacity reserved for the last day by \\( Q \\).\n\nThe z-score corresponding to \\( Q \\) is given by:\n\\[ z = \\frac{Q - 375}{100} \\]\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( Q \\) such that the probability of the demand being greater than or equal to \\( Q \\) is equal to the probability that Kitchen Trims will sell all the trims they produce on the last day. Since all production capacity gets booked about one week in advance, we can assume that the company sells all the trims they produce on the last day if the demand is less than or equal to 1,500 units. Therefore, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) such that the probability of the demand being less than or equal to \\( Q \\) is 0.5 (since the company will sell all the trims they produce on the last day if the demand is less than or equal to 1,500 units).\n\nThis means we need to find the z-score corresponding to the 50th percentile of the standard normal distribution. The 50th percentile of the standard normal distribution is 0. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ z = 0 \\]\n\\[ 0 = \\frac{Q - 1500}{100} \\]\n\\[ Q = 1500 - 0 \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ Q = 1375 \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation is not correct because we need to consider the probability of the demand being greater than or equal to 1,375 units. Instead, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) such that the probability of the demand being greater than or equal to \\( Q \\) is 0.5. This means we need to find the z-score corresponding to the 75th percentile of the standard normal distribution. The 75th percentile of the standard normal distribution is approximately 0.6745. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ z = 0.6745 \\]\n\\[ 0.6745 = \\frac{Q - 1500}{100} \\]\n\\[ Q = 1500 + 0.6745 \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ Q = 1500 + 67.45 \\]\n\\[ Q = 1600 \\]\n\nTherefore, Kitchen Trims should reserve \\boxed{1000} units of production capacity for the last day.",
            "To determine how much production capacity Kitchen Trims should reserve for the last day, we need to consider the demand for the high-price segment 10 days in advance and the capacity constraints.\n\n1. **Identify the demand distribution:**\n   - Mean demand: \\( \\mu = 375 \\)\n   - Standard deviation: \\( \\sigma = 100 \\)\n   - Demand is normally distributed.\n\n2. **Determine the service level:**\n   Since customers who want to buy trims on the last day are willing to pay an additional \u20ac6, the high-price segment will buy trims on the last day if they cannot get them within the first 10 days. We need to find the service level that corresponds to the probability of meeting the demand within the first 10 days.\n\n3. **Calculate the probability of meeting the demand within the first 10 days:**\n   Let \\( D \\) be the demand on the last day. We want to find \\( P(D \\leq Q) \\), where \\( Q \\) is the production capacity reserved for the last day.\n\n4. **Convert the service level to a z-score:**\n   The z-score for a given service level \\( \\alpha \\) is:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the service level for the last day:**\n   Since customers who want to buy trims on the last day are willing to pay an additional \u20ac6, we need to find the service level that ensures they can buy trims on the last day if they cannot get them within the first 10 days. This service level is typically determined by the company's profit considerations and market strategy. For simplicity, we will assume a high service level of 95%.\n\n6. **Find the z-score corresponding to the 95th percentile:**\n   From the standard normal distribution table, the z-score corresponding to the 95th percentile is approximately \\( z = 1.645 \\).\n\n7. **Calculate the production capacity \\( Q \\):**\n   Using the z-score formula:\n   \\[\n   1.645 = \\frac{Q - 375}{100}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( Q \\):\n   \\[\n   Q = 1.645 \\times 100 + 375 = 164.5 + 375 = 539.5\n   \\]\n\nSince production capacity must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:\n\\[\nQ = 540\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Kitchen Trims should reserve \\(\\boxed{540}\\) units of production capacity for the last day.",
            "To determine how much production capacity Kitchen Trims should reserve for the last day, we need to analyze the demand for the high-price segment of the trims. The high-price segment is sold at \u20ac18 per unit, and it is known that the demand for these trims is normally distributed with a mean of 375 units and a standard deviation of 100 units, 10 days in advance.\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability that the demand for the high-price segment will exceed the production capacity reserved for the last day. Let's denote the production capacity reserved for the last day as \\( x \\). The demand for the high-price segment can be modeled by a normal distribution \\( N(375, 100^2) \\).\n\nWe want to find the value of \\( x \\) such that the probability of the demand exceeding \\( x \\) is minimized while ensuring that the company does not lose out on potential sales. A reasonable approach is to choose \\( x \\) such that the probability of the demand exceeding \\( x \\) is quite small, typically around 5% or less. This corresponds to the 95th percentile of the normal distribution.\n\nThe z-score corresponding to the 95th percentile of the standard normal distribution is approximately 1.645. Therefore, we can use the z-score formula to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values (\\(\\mu = 375\\) and \\(\\sigma = 100\\)) and the z-score of 1.645, we get:\n\n\\[\n1.645 = \\frac{x - 375}{100}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 1.645 \\times 100 + 375 = 164.5 + 375 = 539.5\n\\]\n\nSince the production capacity must be a whole number, we round 539.5 to the nearest whole number, which is 540. Therefore, Kitchen Trims should reserve \\(\\boxed{540}\\) units of production capacity for the last day.",

            "To determine how much production capacity Kitchen Trims should reserve for the last day, we need to analyze the demand for the high-price segment of trims. The high-price segment is those trims sold about 10 days in advance, and it follows a normal distribution with a mean of 375 units and a standard deviation of 100 units.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the probability that the demand for the high-price segment will be less than or equal to a certain number of units. We want to find the number of units \\( x \\) such that the probability of demand being less than or equal to \\( x \\) is high enough to ensure that we can meet the demand on the last day with a high probability.\n\nA common approach is to use the service level, which is the probability that the demand will be met. A typical service level for inventory management is 95%, meaning we want to ensure that we have enough capacity to meet the demand 95% of the time.\n\nWe need to find the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.95. From standard normal distribution tables, we find that the z-score for a cumulative probability of 0.95 is approximately 1.645.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\mu \\) is the mean and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\\[\n1.645 = \\frac{x - 375}{100}\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 1.645 \\times 100 + 375 = 164.5 + 375 = 539.5\n\\]\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a unit, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, \\( x = 540 \\).\n\nThis means that Kitchen Trims should reserve 540 units of production capacity for the last day to ensure that they can meet the demand with a 95% probability.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{540}\n\\]",

The high-price segment is sold at \u20ac18 per unit, and the demand for this segment is normally distributed with a mean of 375 units and a standard deviation of 100 units. We need to find the probability that the demand will exceed the production capacity reserved for the last day and then use this probability to determine the optimal production capacity.\n\nFirst, let's denote the production capacity reserved for the last day by \\( Q \\). The probability that the demand will exceed \\( Q \\) is given by the standard normal distribution. We need to find \\( Q \\) such that the probability of demand exceeding \\( Q \\) is minimized while ensuring that the company can meet the demand most of the time.\n\nThe z-score for the demand \\( D \\) is given by:\n\\[ z = \\frac{D - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\nwhere \\( \\mu = 375 \\) and \\( \\sigma = 100 \\). We want to find \\( Q \\) such that the probability \\( P(D > Q) \\) is small. A common choice for this probability is 5%, which corresponds to a z-score of approximately 1.645 (from the standard normal distribution table).\n\nSo, we set up the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{Q - 375}{100} = -1.645 \\]\nSolving for \\( Q \\):\n\\[ Q = 375 - 1.645 \\times 100 = 375 - 164.5 = 210.5 \\]\nSince \\( Q \\) must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives \\( Q = 211 \\).\n\nTherefore, Kitchen Trims should reserve \\(\\boxed{211}\\) units of production capacity for the last day."

            "To determine the optimal quantity for Alexandria to order, we need to consider the costs and benefits of holding inventory. The key factors are the cost of holding inventory, the cost of backorders, and the profit from selling the body armor.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- \\( Q \\) is the quantity of body armor ordered.\n- \\( D \\) is the demand, which is normally distributed with a mean of 250 units and a standard deviation of 50 units.\n- \\( C \\) is the cost of production per unit, which is \\$3.\n- \\( P \\) is the selling price per unit, which is \\$650.\n- \\( H \\) is the holding cost per unit, which we can assume to be the opportunity cost of the investment. Since the average investment in a product is \\$3, we can assume the holding cost per unit is also \\$3 (if we assume the holding cost is the same as the production cost).\n\nThe profit from selling the body armor is given by the selling price minus the production cost. If the retailer sells \\( \\min(Q, D) \\) units, the profit is:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = (P - C) \\min(Q, D) = (650 - 3) \\min(Q, D) = 647 \\min(Q, D) \\]\n\nThe cost of holding inventory is:\n\\[ \\text{Holding Cost} = H (Q - D)^+ \\]\nwhere \\( (Q - D)^+ \\) is the positive part of \\( Q - D \\), i.e., \\( (Q - D)^+ = \\max(Q - D, 0) \\).\n\nThe expected profit is the expected value of the profit minus the expected holding cost:\n\\[ \\text{Expected Profit} = 647 E[\\min(Q, D)] - 3 E[(Q - D)^+] \\]\n\nTo find the optimal \\( Q \\), we need to calculate \\( E[\\min(Q, D)] \\) and \\( E[(Q - D)^+] \\). Using the properties of the normal distribution, we can use the following formulas:\n\\[ E[\\min(Q, D)] = \\mu D \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - \\mu D}{\\sigma D}\\right) + (Q - \\mu D) \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - \\mu D}{\\sigma D}\\right) \\]\n\\[ E[(Q - D)^+] = (Q - \\mu D) (1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - \\mu D}{\\sigma D}\\right)) \\]\nwhere \\( \\mu D = 250 \\), \\( \\sigma D = 50 \\), \\( \\phi \\) is the standard normal density function, and \\( \\Phi \\) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.\n\nThe optimal \\( Q \\) is found by setting the derivative of the expected profit with respect to \\( Q \\) to zero and solving for \\( Q \\).

            "To determine the optimal quantity for Alexandria to order, we need to consider the costs and benefits of holding inventory and the potential lost sales due to excess inventory.

The expected overstock is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Expected overstock} = Q^* - E(D) + \\sigma \\phi(z) \\]\nwhere \\( E(D) \\) is the expected demand and \\( \\phi(z) \\) is the probability density function (PDF) of the standard normal distribution at \\( z \\).\n\nFrom the standard normal distribution table, we find:\n\\[ \\phi(0.91) \\approx 0.3621 \\]\n\nNow, we substitute the values into the formula for expected overstock:\n\\[ \\text{Expected overstock} = 5593 - 4000 + 1750 \\times 0.3621 = 1593 + 633.675 = 2226.675 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the expected overstock is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2227} \\]",

Therefore, the expected number of dresses sold is:\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Dresses sold}] = Q - 800\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the expected profit:**\n   The profit for each dress sold is \\$10, and the loss for each excess dress is \\$5. The expected profit can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit} = 10 \\cdot E[\\text{Dresses sold}] - 5 \\cdot E[\\text{Excess dresses}]\n   \\]\n   The expected number of excess dresses is the expected number of dresses produced minus the expected number of dresses sold. Since the production capacity is 5,000 dresses, the expected number of excess dresses is:\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Excess dresses}] = \\max(0, 5000 - Q + 800) = \\max(0, 5800 - Q)\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the expected profit is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit} = 10 \\cdot (Q - 800) - 5 \\cdot \\max(0, 5800 - Q)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the optimal number of orders:**\n   We need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that maximizes the expected profit. We consider two cases:\n   - If \\( Q \\leq 5800 \\), then \\( \\max(0, 5800 - Q) = 5800 - Q \\). The expected profit is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Expected profit} = 10 \\cdot (Q - 800) - 5 \\cdot (5800 - Q) = 10Q - 8000 - 29000 + 5Q = 15Q - 37000\n     \\]\n     This is a linear function that increases with \\( Q \\), so the maximum profit in this range occurs at \\( Q = 5800 \\).\n   - If \\( Q > 5800 \\), then \\( \\max(0, 5800 - Q) = 0 \\). The expected profit is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Expected profit} = 10 \\cdot (Q - 800) - 5 \\cdot 0 = 10Q - 8000\n     \\]\n     This is also a linear function that increases with \\( Q \\), but since the production capacity is 5,000 dresses, \\( Q \\) cannot be greater than 5,000.\n\n   Therefore, the maximum expected profit occurs at \\( Q = 5000 \\).\n\nThe optimal number of orders the supplier should accept is \\(\\boxed{5000}\\)."

            "To determine the number of donkeys the cruise line should have in its herd, we need to calculate the expected cost of the donkey capacity.
