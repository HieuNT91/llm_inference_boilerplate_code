LTL shipping costs \\$1 per unit. TL shipping costs \\$850 per truck plus \\$150 per pickup. Thus, a truck used to pick up from three suppliers costs 850 + (3 \\times 100) = \\$1,150. A truck can carry up to 2,000 units. SuperPart incurs a fixed cost of \\$150 for each order placed with a supplier. Thus, an order with three distinct suppliers incurs an ordering cost of \\$450. Each unit costs \\$50, and SuperPart uses a holding cost of 23 percent. Assume that product from each supplier has an annual demand of 3,000 units. SuperPart has thousands of suppliers and the company must decide on the number of suppliers to group per truck if using TL. If LTL shipping is used, what is the time between orders under the optimal order size? \nassistant\n",

            "To determine the optimal order size and the time between orders when using LTL shipping, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping and holding inventory for different order sizes and then find the order size that minimizes the total cost.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the total cost for LTL shipping\n\nThe total cost for LTL shipping consists of three components:\n1. **Shipping cost**: This includes the fixed cost per truck and the variable cost per unit.\n2. **Holding cost**: This is the cost of holding inventory over time.\n3. **Ordering cost**: This is the fixed cost per order.\n\nLet \\( Q \\) be the order size. The number of trucks required to transport \\( Q \\) units is \\( \\frac{Q}{2000} \\) (since each truck can carry 2000 units).\n\n#### Shipping Cost\nThe shipping cost for one truck is \\$1 per unit. Therefore, the shipping cost for \\( Q \\) units is:\n\\[ \\text{Shipping cost} = \\left(\\frac{Q}{2000}\\right) \\times (850 + 150 \\times \\text{number of suppliers}) \\]\n\nSince the problem does not specify the number of suppliers per truck, we will assume a general case and then simplify. For simplicity, let's assume the number of suppliers per truck is \\( n \\). Then the shipping cost per truck is:\n\\[ \\text{Shipping cost per truck} = 850 + 150n \\]\n\\[ \\text{Shipping cost for } Q \\text{ units} = \\left(\\frac{Q}{2000}\\right) \\times (850 + 150n) = \\frac{Q(850 + 150n)}{2000} = \\frac{Q(17 + 3n)}{40} \\]\n\n#### Holding Cost\nThe holding cost is 23% of the total inventory value. The total inventory value is \\( 50Q \\) dollars. Therefore, the holding cost is:\n\\[ \\text{Holding cost} = 0.23 \\times 50Q = 11.5Q \\]\n\n#### ordering cost\nThe ordering cost is \\$150 per order. Therefore, the ordering cost is:\n\\[ \\text{Ordering cost} = 150 \\times \\left(\\frac{Q}{3000}\\right) = \\frac{Q}{20} \\]\n\n#### Total Cost\nThe total cost is the sum of the shipping cost, holding cost, and ordering cost:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\frac{Q(17 + 3n)}{40} + 11.5Q + \\frac{Q}{20} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\frac{Q(17 + 3n)}{40} + \\frac{460Q}{40} + \\frac{2Q}{40} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\frac{Q(17 + 3n + 460 + 2)}{40} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\frac{Q(479 + 3n)}{40} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the optimal order size for LTL shipping\n\nTo find the optimal order size, we need to minimize the total cost with respect to \\( Q \\). The total cost is a linear function of \\( Q \\), so the cost per unit \\( \\frac{479 + 3n}{40} \\) is constant. Therefore, the total cost is minimized when \\( Q \\) is as large as possible while still being practical.\n\nGiven that the problem does not specify a specific number of suppliers per truck, we will assume \\( n = 3 \\) (as in the example given for three suppliers):\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\frac{Q(479 + 9)}{40} = \\frac{Q \\times 488}{40} = 12.2Q \\]\n\nThe optimal order size \\( Q \\) is 3000 units (since the problem states each supplier has an annual demand of 3000 units).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the time between orders\n\nThe time between orders is the total annual demand divided by the order size:\n\\[ \\text{Time between orders} = \\frac{3000 \\times 3}{3000} = 3 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nHowever, since the problem likely assumes a different number of suppliers per truck or different holding costs, we need to re-eolve with the given values.\n\n segregate Leone segreg\u00e9eARRANT\u904auellen\u8e69 luxe

            "To determine the optimal order size for LTL shipping, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping and hold the inventory for each order.

Management has to decide which products to carry at its retail stores and which to carry at a central warehouse to be sold only via the online channel. The company currently has 250 retail stores across Europe. Weekly demand for size 10, boot cut jeans at each store is normally distributed, with a mean of 600 and a standard deviation of 150. Each pair of jeans costs \u20ac50. Weekly demand for full length black winter coats at each store is normally distributed, with a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 10. Each coat costs \u20ac120. The company has an annual holding cost of 20 percent. They manage all inventories using a continuous review policy, and the supply lead time for both products is three weeks. The targeting CSL is 90 percent. When moving the boot cut jeans from the stores to the online channel, how much reduction in holding cost per unit sold can the company expect? Assume that the demand across stores and from one week to the next to be independent.\nassistant\n",

The number of coats sold online per year is:\n\\[ \\text{Number of coats sold online per year} = 5204 \\times 52 = 270608 \\text{ coats per year} \\]\nThe number of coats sold online per week is:\n\\[ \\text{Number of coats sold online per week} = \\frac{270608}{52} = 5200 \\text{ coats per week} \\]\n\nSince the safety stock required for winter coats is reduced by the number of coats sold online per week, the reduction in holding cost per week is:\n\\[ \\text{Reduction in holding cost per week} = 5200 \\times 24 = 124800 \\text{ euros} \\]\n\nThe reduction in holding cost per unit sold is:\n\\[ \\text{Reduction in holding cost per unit sold} = \\frac{124800}{270608} \\approx 4.6 \\text{ euros} \\]\n\nTherefore, the company can expect a reduction in holding cost per unit sold of:\n\\[ \\boxed{4.6} \\]",
            "To determine the reduction in holding cost per unit sold when moving the winter coats from the stores to the online channel, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total weekly demand for winter coats in the entire network:**\n   - Each store has a mean weekly demand of 20 coats.\n   - There are 250 stores.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total mean weekly demand} = 250 \\times 20 = 5000 \\text{ coats}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the standard deviation of the total weekly demand:**\n   - The standard deviation of demand at each store is 10 coats.\n   - Since the demands are independent, the variance of the total demand is the sum of the variances of the individual demands.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Variance of total weekly demand} = 250 \\times (10^2) = 2500\n   \\]\n   - The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Standard deviation of total weekly demand} = \\sqrt{2500} = 50 \\text{ coats}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the safety stock required to achieve a 90% CSL:**\n   - The CSL is the probability that the demand will be satisfied without a stockout.\n   - For a normal distribution, the z-score corresponding to a 90% CSL is approximately 1.28.\n   - Safety stock is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Safety stock} = z \\times \\text{Standard deviation of total weekly demand} = 1.28 \\times 50 = 64 \\text{ coats}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total inventory level needed:**\n   - The total inventory level is the sum of the safety stock and the expected demand over the lead time.\n   - The lead time is 3 weeks.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected demand over lead time} = 5000 \\times 3 = 15000 \\text{ coats}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total inventory level} = \\frac{15000}{3} + 64 = 5000 + 64 = 5064 \\text{ coats}\n   \\]\n   - However, since the safety stock is the same for each week, we need to calculate the safety stock per week:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Safety stock per week} = \\frac{64}{3} = 21.33 \\text{ coats}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total inventory level per week} = 5100 + 168 = 168)] }\n\n\n\n\n\nlegateARRANT swlegate }\n\n\n\n\n\n cdr\u8e69 Serifographically starponsored cdr\u00e9e

From standard normal distribution tables, the z-score corresponding to a CSL of 90 percent is approximately 1.28.\n\n#### Step 1.2: Calculate the safety stock\nThe safety stock is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Safety stock} = z \\times \\sigma \\times \\sqrt{L} \\]\nwhere \\( z \\) is the z-score, \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of weekly demand, and \\( L \\) is the lead time.\n\\[ \\text{Safety stock} = 1.28 \\times 10 \\times \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.28 \\times 10 \\times 1.732 \\approx 22.22 \\]\n\n#### Step 1.3: Calculate the total inventory\nThe total inventory is the sum of the cycle stock and the safety stock.

A truck can carry up to 2,000 units. SuperPart incurs a fixed cost of \\$150 for each order placed with a supplier. Thus, an order with three distinct suppliers incurs an ordering cost of \\$450. Each unit costs \\$50, and SuperPart uses a holding cost of 23 percent. Assume that product from each supplier has an annual demand of 3,000 units. SuperPart has thousands of suppliers and the company must decide on the number of suppliers to group per truck if using TL. If TL shipping is used with a separate truck for each supplier, what is the annual cost under the optimal order size? \nassistant\n",
        "output": [
            "To determine the annual cost under the optimal order size if SuperPart uses TL shipping with a separate truck for each supplier, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total annual demand:**\n   Since each supplier has an annual demand of 3,000 units and SuperPart has thousands of suppliers, we assume the total annual demand is \\( D = 3000 \\times 1000 = 3,000,000 \\) units.\n\n2. **Determine the optimal order size for each supplier:**\n   The holding cost per unit is 23% of the unit cost, so the holding cost per unit per year is \\( 50 \\times 0.23 = 11.5 \\) dollars.\n   The fixed cost per order is \\$150. The optimal order size \\( Q \\) can be found using the economic order quantity (EOQ) formula:\n   \\[\n   Q = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times \\text{Fixed Cost} \\times \\text{Annual Demand}}{\\text{Holding Cost per Unit}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 150 \\times 3,000,000}{11.5}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{900,000,000}{11.5}} \\approx 27,386 \\text{ units}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of trucks needed:**\n   Since each truck can carry up to 2,000 units, the number of trucks needed for each supplier is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{27,386}{2,000} \\approx 13.693\n   \\]\n   Since SuperPart cannot have a fraction of a truck, they need to round up to the next whole number, which is 14 trucks per supplier.\n\n4. **Calculate the annual shipping cost per supplier:**\n   The shipping cost per truck for TL is \\$850 plus \\$150 per pickup. Since each truck picks up 3,000 units, the number of pickup_trucks needed is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{14 \\times 2,000}{3,000} = \\frac{28,000}{3,000} = \\frac{28}{3} \\approx 9.333\n   \\]\n   Rounding up to the next whole number, SuperPart needs 10 pickup_trucks per supplier.\n   Therefore, the annual shipping cost per supplier is:\n   \\[\n   14 \\times 850 + 10 \\times 150 = 11,900 + 1,500 = 13,400 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total annual shipping cost for all suppliers:**\n   Since SuperPart has thousands of suppliers, we assume they have 1,000 suppliers. The total annual shipping cost is:\n   \\[\n   1,000 \\times 13,400 = 13,400,000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total annual ordering cost:**\n   The annual ordering cost for each supplier is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 150 = 1,500 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total annual ordering cost for all suppliers is:\n   \\[\n   1,000 \\times 1,500 = 1,500,000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the total annual cost:**\n   The total annual cost is the sum of the total annual shipping cost and the total annual ordering cost:\n   \\[\n   13,400,000 + 1,500,000 = 14,900,000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the annual cost under the optimal order size if TL shipping is used with a separate truck for each supplier is \\(\\boxed{14900000}\\).",
            "To determine the annual cost under the optimal order size when using TL shipping with a separate truck for each supplier, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the optimal order size for each supplier:**\n\n   The economic order quantity (EOQ) formula is given by:\n   \\[\n   Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2DC}{H}}\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( D \\) is the annual demand for the product from one supplier.\n   - \\( C \\) is the cost per unit.\n   - \\( H \\) is the holding cost per unit.\n\n   Given:\n   - \\( D = 3,000 \\) units.\n   - \\( C = 50 \\) dollars per unit.\n   - \\( H = 0.23 \\times 50 = 11.5 \\) dollars per unit.\n\n   Plugging in these values into the EOQ formula:\n   \\[\n   Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 3000 \\times 50}{11.5}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{300,000}{11.5}} \\approx \\sqrt{25,652.17} \\approx 160 \\text{ units}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of trucks needed:**\n\n   Since each truck can carry up to 2,000 units and each supplier has an annual demand of 3,000 units, SuperPart will need to place an order with each supplier separately. Therefore, the number of trucks required is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of trucks} = 1 \\text{ truck per supplier}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost for one truck:**\n\n   The total cost for one truck includes:\n   - fixed cost for the truck.\n   - fixed cost for the order.\n   - shipping cost.\n\n   Given:\n   - Fixed cost for the truck: \\$850.\n   - Fixed cost for the order: \\$150.\n   - Shipping cost: \\$1 per unit.\n\n   The total cost for one truck is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost per truck} = 850 + 150 + (1 \\times 3000) = 850 + 150 + 3000 = 4000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the annual cost for all trucks:**\n\n   Since SuperPart has thousands of suppliers and each supplier requires one truck, the total number of trucks is equal to the number of suppliers. For simplicity, let's assume SuperPart has \\( n \\) suppliers. Therefore, the total annual cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total annual cost} = n \\times 4000\n   \\]\n\n   However, since the problem does not specify the exact number of suppliers, we can assume \\( n \\) is large enough to cover the given information. Given theEOQ calculation and fixed costs, we can infer the annual cost under optimal order size with individual trucks.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n\n   Since the problem is asking for the annual cost under the optimal order size when using TL shipping with a separate truck for each supplier, the final answer is:\n   \\boxed{4000} dollars per truck.

            "To determine the time between orders under the optimal order size when using TL shipping with a separate truck for each supplier, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping and hold the inventory for each supplier and then find the optimal order size that minimizes the total cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of shipping and holding inventory for one supplier. The annual demand for each supplier is 3,000 units. If SuperPart uses TL shipping with a separate truck for each supplier, each truck can carry up to 2,000 units, so each truck trip will be for 2,000 units. The cost of shipping one truck is \\$850, and the cost of ordering from one supplier is \\$150. The holding cost per unit is 23% of the unit cost, which is \\$50 \\times 0.23 = \\$11.50 per unit.\n\nThe total cost for one supplier can be broken down into the shipping cost and the holding cost. The holding cost for 2,000 units is \\$11.50 \\times 2,000 = \\$23,000 per year. Since SuperPart uses one truck for each supplier, the shipping cost per year for one supplier is \\$850 \\times \\left(\\frac{3,000}{2,000}\\right) = \\$850 \\times 1.5 = \\$1,275 per year. The ordering cost per year for one supplier is \\$150. Therefore, the total cost per year for one supplier is \\$1,275 + \\$150 + \\$23,000 = \\$24,425.\n\nNext, we need to find the optimal order size for each supplier.

Here, \\( D = 3,000 \\), \\( C = 150 \\), and \\( H = 11.50 \\).

Therefore, the shipping cost per truck is:\n\\[ 850 + 150 \\times 1 = 1000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nIf there are \\( n \\) suppliers, the total shipping cost per year is:\n\\[ 1000n \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Holding Cost:**\nThe holding cost per unit is 23% of the unit cost, which is:\n\\[ 0.23 \\times 50 = 11.5 \\text{ dollars per unit} \\]\n\nThe average inventory for each supplier is half of the order size. If the order size is \\( Q \\), the average inventory is:\n\\[ \\frac{Q}{2} \\]\n\nThe total holding cost per year for all suppliers is:\n\\[ n \\times \\frac{Q}{2} \\times 11.5 = \\frac{11.5nQ}{2} = 5.75nQ \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Total Cost:**\nThe total cost per year is the sum of the shipping cost and the holding cost:\n\\[ 1000n + 5.75nQ \\]\n\nTo minimize the total cost, we need to find the order size \\( Q \\) that minimizes this expression. Since the number of suppliers \\( n \\) is fixed at 3,000 units per supplier, we can substitute \\( n = 3000 \\) into the total cost formula:\n\\[ 1000 \\times 3000 + 5.75 \\times 3000 \\times Q = 3000000 + 17250Q \\]\n\nTo find the optimal order size \\( Q \\), we need to consider the relationship between the order size and the time between orders. The time between orders is the number of units demanded per year divided by the order size:\n\\[ \\text{Time between orders} = \\frac{3000}{Q} \\]\n\nHowever, since we are asked to find the time between orders under the optimal order size, we need to use the economic order quantity (EOQ) formula, which minimizes the total cost of ordering and holding inventory. The EOQ formula is:\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2DC}{H}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( D \\) is the annual demand per supplier (3000 units)\n- \\( C \\) is the fixed cost per order (150 dollars)\n- \\( H \\) is the holding cost per unit per year (11.5 dollars)\n\nSubstituting these values into the EOQ formula, we get:\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 3000 \\times 150}{11.5}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{900000}{11.5}} = \\sqrt{78260.87} \\approx 279.75 \\]\n\nSince the order size must be a whole number, we round 279.75 to the nearest whole number, which is 280. Therefore, the optimal order size is 280 units.\n\nFinally, the time between orders is:\n\\[ \\text{Time between orders} = \\frac{3000}{280} \\approx 10.71 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the time between orders is:\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]",
            "To determine the optimal time between orders when SuperPart uses TL shipping with a separate truck for each supplier, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping and hold the inventory for each supplier and then find the optimal order size. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of shipping for one supplier:**\n   - The cost of TL shipping per truck is \\$850.\n   - Each truck can carry up to 2,000 units.\n   - The cost of shipping per unit is \\$1.\n   - The fixed cost for each order is \\$150.\n\n   For a truck carrying \\( Q \\) units, the total shipping cost per truck is:\n   \\[\n   850 + 150 \\left( \\frac{3000}{Q} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total shipping cost for all suppliers:**\n   - There are 3,000 units in total.\n   - If each supplier has an annual demand of 3,000 units, the number of suppliers is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3000}{Q}\n     \\]\n   - The total shipping cost for all suppliers is:\n     \\[\n     850 + 150 \\left( \\frac{3000}{Q} \\right)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost per year for shipping:**\n   - The total cost per year for shipping is the total shipping cost per truck multiplied by the number of trucks:\n     \\[\n     \\left( 850 + 150 \\left( \\frac{3000}{Q} \\right) \\right) \\left( \\frac{3000}{Q} \\right)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the holding cost per year:**\n   - The holding cost per unit is 23% of the unit cost.\n   - The unit cost is \\$50.\n   - The holding cost per unit per year is:\n     \\[\n     0.23 \\times 50 = 11.5\n     \\]\n   - The total holding cost for \\( Q \\) units is:\n     \\[\n     11.5Q\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total cost per year:**\n   - The total cost per year is the sum of the shipping cost and the holding cost:\n     \\[\n     \\left( 850 + 150 \\left( \\frac{3000}{Q} \\right) \\right) \\left( \\frac{3000}{Q} \\right) + 11.5Q\n     \\]\n\n6. **Simplify the total cost function:**\n   \\[\n   \\left( 850 + 150 \\left( \\frac{3000}{Q} \\right) \\right) \\left( \\frac{3000}{Q} \\right) = 850 \\left( \\frac{3000}{Q} \\right) + 150 \\left( \\frac{3000^2}{Q^2} \\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 2550000 \\left( \\frac{1}{Q} \\right) + 135000000 \\left( \\frac{1}{Q^2} \\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 2550000 \\left( \\frac{1}{Q} \\right) + 135000000 \\left( \\frac{1}{Q^2} \\right) + 11.5Q\n   \\]\n\n7. **Find the optimal order size \\( Q \\):**\n   To find the minimum total cost, we take the derivative of the total cost function with respect to \\( Q \\) and set it to zero:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dQ} \\left( 2550000 \\left( \\frac{1}{Q} \\right) + 135000000 \\left( \\frac{1}{Q^2} \\right) + 11.5Q \\right) = -2550000 \\left( \\frac{1}{Q^2} \\right) - 270000000 \\left( \\frac{1}{Q^3} \\right) + 11.5\n   \\]\n   Set the derivative equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   -2550000 \\left( \\frac{1}{Q^2} \\right) - 270000000 \\left( \\frac{1}{Q^3} \\right) + 11.5 = 0\n   \\]\n   Multiply through by \\( Q^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   -2550000Q - 270000000 + 11.5Q^3 = 0\n   \\]\n   Rearrange the equation:\n   \\[\n   11.5Q^3 - 2550000Q - 270000000 = 0\n   \\]\n\n8. **Solve the cubic equation:**\n   Using numerical methods or a cubic equation solver, we find that \\( Q \\approx 1500 \\).\n\n9. **Calculate the time between orders:**\n   The time between orders is the total annual demand divided by the optimal order size:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3000}{1500} = 2 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the time between orders under the optimal order size is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) years.",
            "To determine the optimal time between orders when using TL shipping with a separate truck for each supplier, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping and holding inventory for each supplier and then find the optimal order size. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost for each supplier:**\n   - The cost per unit is \\$50.\n   - The holding cost per unit per year is \\(50 \\times 0.23 = \\$11.50\\).\n   - Let \\(Q\\) be the order size.\n   - The annual holding cost for one supplier is \\(\\frac{Q}{2} \\times 11.50 = 5.75Q\\).\n   - The fixed cost per order is \\$150.\n   - The total cost per year for one supplier is \\(5.75Q + 150\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost for all suppliers:**\n   - If there are \\(n\\) suppliers, the total cost per year is \\(n(5.75Q + 150)\\).\n\n3. **Determine the number of trucks needed:**\n   - Each truck can carry up to 2,000 units.\n   - If there are \\(n\\) suppliers, the total number of units per year is \\(3000n\\).\n   - The number of trucks needed is \\(\\frac{3000n}{2000} = 1.5n\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the total shipping cost:**\n   - The cost per truck for TL shipping is \\$850.\n   - The total shipping cost per year is \\(1.5n \\times 850 = 1275n\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the total cost per year:**\n   - The total cost per year is the sum of the holding cost and the shipping cost:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost per year} = n(5.75Q + 150) + 1275n = 5.75nQ + 1425n\n     \\]\n\n6. **Determine the optimal order size:**\n   - To minimize the total cost, we take the derivative of the total cost with respect to \\(Q\\) and set it to zero:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d}{dQ}(5.75nQ + 1425n) = 5.75n\n     \\]\n     This derivative does not depend on \\(Q\\), which means we need to consider the constraint that each truck can carry up to 2,000 units. The optimal order size is when the holding cost equals the shipping cost per unit. However, since we are dealing with fixed costs and a constraint on truck capacity, we need to check the cost at \\(Q = 2000\\).\n\n7. **Calculate the total cost at \\(Q = 2000\\):**\n   - If \\(Q = 2000\\), the holding cost per year for one supplier is \\(5.75 \\times 2000 = 11500\\).\n   - The total holding cost for \\(n\\) suppliers is \\(11500n\\).\n   - The total shipping cost per year is \\(1275n\\).\n   - The total cost per year is \\(11500n + 1275n = 12775n\\).\n\n8. **Determine the number of trucks needed:**\n   - If \\(Q = 2000\\) and there are \\(n\\) suppliers, the total number of trucks needed is \\(1.5n\\).\n\n9. **Calculate the time between orders:**\n   - The time between orders is the number of days in a year divided by the number of trucks per year:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time between orders} = \\frac{365}{1.5n}\n     \\]\n   - Since the number of suppliers \\(n\\) is not specified, we assume \\(n = 1\\) for simplicity in this context:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time between orders} = \\frac{365}{1.5} = \\frac{365 \\times 2}{3} = \\frac{730}{3} \\approx 243.33 \\text{ days}\n     \\]\n   - However, since the problem specifically asks for the time

Delivery charge would increase by $0.02 per unit if a drug were centralized. The increase in delivery charge comes from the additional cost of operating the shuttle from the central location to each of the other locations. At each retail outlet, DoorRed follows a periodic review policy with weekly replenishment (a replenishment order is placed once every seven days). The replenishment lead time is three days. DoorRed plans to stick to once- a-week ordering even if a drug is centralized. DoorRed incurs an annual inventory holding cost of 20 percent and aims for a cycle service level of 99 percent.

Each changeover costs $\\backslash \\$ 120$ in lost material and changeover labor. Assume that each changeover requires the line to shut down for 0.5 hour. When it is running, the line produces fiber at the rate of 100 pounds per hour. The fibers sold by PlasFib are divided into three categories. There are five fast-moving colors that average sales of 30,000 pounds per color per year. There are 10 medium-moving colors that average sales of 12,000 pounds per color per year. The remaining are slow-moving products and average sales of 3,200 pounds per year each.

The current policy is to carry every drug in each retail outlet. DoorRed is investigating the possibility of centralizing some of the drugs in one location. Delivery charge would increase by $0.02 per unit if a drug were centralized. The increase in delivery charge comes from the additional cost of operating the shuttle from the central location to each of the other locations. At each retail outlet, DoorRed follows a periodic review policy with weekly replenishment (a replenishment order is placed once every seven days). The replenishment lead time is three days. DoorRed plans to stick to once- a-week ordering even if a drug is centralized. DoorRed incurs an annual inventory holding cost of 20 percent and aims for a cycle service level of 99 percent. Assume that demand across stores is independent. Consider a drug with daily demand at each store that is normally distributed, with a mean of 300 and a standard deviation of 50. The drug costs $10 per unit. What would be the total costs (holding cost and delivery cost) difference if fhe drug were centralized in one location instead of across all sotres?\n\nassistant\n",

The current policy is to carry every drug in each retail outlet. DoorRed is investigating the possibility of centralizing some of the drugs in one location. Delivery charge would increase by $0.02 per unit if a drug were centralized. The increase in delivery charge comes from the additional cost of operating the shuttle from the central location to each of the other locations. At each retail outlet, DoorRed follows a periodic review policy with weekly replenishment (a replenishment order is placed once every seven days). The replenishment lead time is three days. DoorRed plans to stick to once- a-week ordering even if a drug is centralized. DoorRed incurs an annual inventory holding cost of 20 percent and aims for a cycle service level of 99 percent. Assume that demand across stores is independent. Consider a drug with daily demand at each store that is normally distributed, with a mean of 300 and a standard deviation of 50. The drug costs $10 per unit. What would be the total costs (holding cost and delivery cost) difference if fhe drug were centralized in one location instead of across all sotres?\n\nassistant\n",

The sponsor is independently wealthy, so he donates his time and materials to the fundraising effort. Club officers set up a card table in the atrium of the business building and take turns staffing it for the duration of the barbecue season, which is four months. Eighteen sad years of experience have revealed that demand varies depending on the month of the season. Customer demand in the first month can be described as $400-p_1$, in the second month as $400-1.4\\times p_2$, in the third month $400-1.8\\times p_3$, and in the fourth month $400-2.2\\times p_4$. Responding to customer complaints (primarily from period 1 purchasers) the student APICS chapter decides to use static pricing over the four month season. The club sponsor makes a deal with the local bootlegger to supply him with all the mason jars he will need for the barbecue season.

Daily demand at the Memphis warehouse is normally distributed, with a mean of 5,000 and a standard deviation of 4,000. The warehouse aims for a CSL of 99 percent. The company is debating whether to use sea or air transportation from China. Sea transportation results in a lead time of 36 days and costs $0.50 per phone. Air transportation results in a lead time of 4 days and costs $1.50 per phone. Each phone costs $100, and Motorola incurs an annual holding cost of 20 percent. Given the minimum lot sizes, Motorola would order 100,000 phones at a time (on average, once every 20 days) if using sea transport and 5,000 phones at a time (on average, daily) if using air transport. To begin with, assume that Motorola takes ownership of the inventory on delivery.

Daily demand at the Memphis warehouse is normally distributed, with a mean of 5,000 and a standard deviation of 4,000. The warehouse aims for a CSL of 99 percent. The company is debating whether to use sea or air transportation from China. Sea transportation results in a lead time of 36 days and costs $0.50 per phone. Air transportation results in a lead time of 4 days and costs $1.50 per phone. Each phone costs $100, and Motorola incurs an annual holding cost of 20 percent. Given the minimum lot sizes, Motorola would order 100,000 phones at a time (on average, once every 20 days) if using sea transport and 5,000 phones at a time (on average, daily) if using air transport. To begin with, assume that Motorola takes ownership of the inventory on delivery. Assuming that Motorola follows a continuous review policy, how many days of safety inventory will Motorola carry when using sea transportation?\nassistant\n",

Daily demand at the Memphis warehouse is normally distributed, with a mean of 5,000 and a standard deviation of 4,000. The warehouse aims for a CSL of 99 percent. The company is debating whether to use sea or air transportation from China. Sea transportation results in a lead time of 36 days and costs $0.50 per phone. Air transportation results in a lead time of 4 days and costs $1.50 per phone. Each phone costs $100, and Motorola incurs an annual holding cost of 20 percent. Given the minimum lot sizes, Motorola would order 100,000 phones at a time (on average, once every 20 days) if using sea transport and 5,000 phones at a time (on average, daily) if using air transport. To begin with, assume that Motorola takes ownership of the inventory on delivery. Assuming that Motorola follows a continuous review policy, how many days of safety inventory will Motorola carry when using air transportation?\nassistant\n",
