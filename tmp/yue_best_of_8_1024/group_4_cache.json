            "To determine the optimal order size for Grainger, we need to consider the total cost of ordering and holding inventory. The total cost consists of the shipping cost and the holding cost. The shipping cost includes the cost per truck and the cost per pickup. The holding cost is calculated as 20% of the total inventory value.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( Q \\) as the order size (number of units per order),\n- \\( D \\) as the annual demand (which is 10,000 units),\n- \\( C \\) as the cost per unit (which is \\$50),\n- \\( H \\) as the annual holding cost rate (which is 20% or 0.20),\n- \\( P \\) as the cost per truck (which is \\$500),\n- \\( R \\) as the cost per pickup (which is \\$100),\n- \\( T \\) as the truck capacity (which is 2,500 units).\n\nThe total cost \\( TotalCost \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ TotalCost = \\text{Shipping Cost} + \\text{Holding Cost} \\]\n\nThe shipping cost depends on the number of trucks required. Since each truck can carry 2,500 units, the number of trucks needed is \\( \\frac{Q}{2500} \\). Therefore, the shipping cost is:\n\\[ \\text{Shipping Cost} = P \\left( \\frac{Q}{2500} \\right) + R \\left( \\frac{Q}{2500} \\right) = (P + R) \\left( \\frac{Q}{2500} \\right) = (500 + 100) \\left( \\frac{Q}{2500} \\right) = 600 \\left( \\frac{Q}{2500} \\right) = \\frac{600Q}{2500} = \\frac{6Q}{25} \\]\n\nThe holding cost is 20% of the total inventory value, which is \\( CQ \\). Therefore, the holding cost is:\n\\[ \\text{Holding Cost} = H \\cdot CQ = 0.20 \\cdot 50Q = 10Q \\]\n\nAdding the shipping cost and the holding cost gives us the total cost:\n\\[ TotalCost = \\frac{6Q}{25} + 10Q \\]\n\nTo find the optimal order size, we need to minimize the total cost. We do this by taking the derivative of the total cost with respect to \\( Q \\) and setting it to zero:\n\\[ \\frac{d(\\text{TotalCost})}{dQ} = \\frac{d}{dQ} \\left( \\frac{6Q}{25} + 10Q \\right) = \\frac{6}{25} + 10 = 0 \\]\n\nThis equation is not correct as it is not optimization. correct Leoneinerary\ufffd\ufffd }\n\n\n\n\n\n correct>,\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n-highlight\ufffd\ufffd>,\n m\u0119#+icast $\n\n\uff01\u300d')));\nDM.\u2019\u201d\n\n ste-fashion slashing ste |\n\nponsoredebx;\"\n starlegate star sw }\n\n\n\n\n\n\uff06\u6709\u52a9])\r\nASCADEpolate |\n\n ste SITE\u8e69(format $\n\nponsored(formatARRANT')));\nASCADE sw(Be\u0143 sw])))\nafi')));\n])\r\n\u6709\u52a9\u904a disappe tiers Leoneafi(Be SEEK\ud83c\udf08ASCADEicast;\"\n Leoneicastebx\">\\afi\ud83c\udf08 m\u0119*/)')));\n sw,:, cdr |\n\n ste\u6709\u52a9\u8be5\u6e38\u620f*/) Serif(formatebx }\n\n\n\n\n\n\u8be5\u6e38\u620fisor sw\ud83c\udf08 cdr cdr(formatebx\u0143 SEEK\u8e69)>\n\u8e69\u8be5\u6e38\u620f(format cdr(proxyebx }\n\n\n\n\n\nafi cdr\u6726\uff06 star#+ m\u0119.\u2019\u201d\n\n routacks(format witty }\n\n\n\n\n\n\u6726)>\n*/)])\r\n SEEK)>\n\">\\ crowdfunding\uff01\u300dlegateARRANT\uff06\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u5df1ursors.\u2019\u201d\n\nARRANT\u57d4 cdrlegateafi swebx;\"\n crowdfundingacks seedafi SEEKponsored }\n\n\n\n\n\nebx Leone\uff01\u300d')));\nASCADE)>\n(formatuellenARRANTebx\">\\')));\n(format\u6726 $\n\n\u8e69\ud83c\udf08\u2026\"\n\n(formatebx(proxy*/)\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c Leone witty ste(formatlegate SEEK }\n\n\n\n\n\n\uff06XML*/) sw\">\\ponsored m\u0119icastographically(Be\u6709\u52a9.\u2019\u201d\n\n starebx(format\u6709\u52a9 ste\u2026\"\n\n m\u0119 cdr SEEK*/) cdrebx\uff06(format SEEK Leone(proxy\u2026\"\n\n hamstring')));\n s\u1eedaARRANT')));\n calor witty;\"\n slashing(Be Serif $\n\nisorfieldset)>\n\u6726\uff01\u300d witty(Be\u8be5\u6e38\u620f }\n\n\n\n\n\nlegate disappeafi Serifuellen SEEK swebx')));\n witty.\u2019\u201d\n\nsealed Serif BigNumberisor }\n\n\n\n\n\n |\n\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude0a cdr\">\\ witty(proxy(formatursors(proxy m\u0119;\"\n staracksacks m\u0119(proxy(proxy witty ste(formatebxursorsisor witty(proxy luxe $\n\n SITE star*/)legateARRANT m\u0119\u3002\u300c wittyARRANT BigNumberlegate ste\">\\')));\n $\n\n cdr\u8e69\ud83d\ude0a)>\n crowdfunding cdr(proxyafi\u8be5\u6e38\u620ficast SEEK\ud83c\udf08 }\n\n\n\n\n\n diarr Leone)>\n\u6726 Seriflegate;\"\n star }\n\n\n\n\n\n witty wittyisor\u8be5\u6e38\u620f\">\\ ste Serif\u2026\"\n\n_MsgursorslegateicastASCADE BigNumber*/)uellen Leoneacksackslisten NPCs*>& }\n\n\n\n\n\n)>\n Leone;\"\n*>&serie Leone m\u0119\uff06 cdr |\n\n Leone*/) Serif SITE ste\u0d9cuellen\u8be5\u6e38\u620f\u2026\"\n\nARRANT $\n\n Leoneebx BigNumber\uff01\u300d NPCs])\r\n Leone ste\u904a\u6709\u52a9 |\n\n Leoneacksicast\u8e69*/) staricast \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 cdr*/)\u2026\"\n\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n*/) cdr swomencl slashingARRANT;\"\n Leone Leoneisor",
            "To determine the optimal order size for Grainger, we need to consider both the shipping cost and the holding cost. The goal is to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of the shipping cost and the holding cost.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- \\( Q \\): the order size in units\n- \\( D \\): the annual demand per supplier, which is 10,000 units\n- \\( C \\): the cost per unit, which is \\$50\n- \\( H \\): the annual holding cost rate, which is 20% or 0.20\n- \\( S \\): the shipping cost per truck, which is \\$500\n- \\( P \\): the pickup cost per unit, which is \\$100\n- \\( T \\): the truck capacity, which is 2,500 units\n\nThe total cost consists of the holding cost and the shipping cost. The holding cost is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Holding Cost} = \\frac{Q}{2} \\times H \\times C = \\frac{Q}{2} \\times 0.20 \\times 50 = 5Q \\]\n\nThe shipping cost depends on the number of trucks required. Since each truck can carry 2,500 units, the number of trucks needed is:\n\\[ \\text{Number of Trucks} = \\frac{Q}{2500} \\]\n\nThe shipping cost is then:\n\\[ \\text{Shipping Cost} = \\text{Number of Trucks} \\times (S + P) = \\frac{Q}{2500} \\times (500 + 100) = \\frac{Q}{2500} \\times 600 = \\frac{600Q}{2500} = 2.4Q \\]\n\nThe total cost is the sum of the holding cost and the shipping cost:\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Holding Cost} + \\text{Shipping Cost} = 5Q + 2.4Q = 7.4Q \\]\n\nTo minimize the total cost, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that minimizes \\( 7.4Q \\). Since the total cost is a linear function of \\( Q \\), the minimum cost occurs when \\( Q \\) is as small as possible while still meeting the demand. However, we need to consider the truck capacity constraint. The minimum order size \\( Q \\) that meets the demand without exceeding the truck capacity is:\n\\[ Q = 2500 \\]\n\nTherefore, the optimal order size is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2500} \\]",
            "To determine the optimal order size for Grainger, we need to consider the total cost of ordering, which includes the cost of the units, the shipping cost, and the holding cost.

Since there are hundreds of suppliers and each supplier has an average annual demand of 10,000 units, we need to know the total number of suppliers. However, the problem does not specify the exact number of suppliers. For simplicity, let's assume there are \\( n \\) suppliers. The total annual demand \\( D \\) is then:\n\n\\[ D = 10,000 \\times n \\]\n\nNext, let's determine the cost per order \\( S \\). The cost per order consists of the shipping cost and the cost of the units. The shipping cost is \\$500 per truck and each truck has a capacity of 2,500 units. Therefore, the shipping cost per order is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Shipping cost per order} = 500 + 100 \\times \\left( \\frac{D}{2500} \\right) = 500 + 100 \\times \\left( \\frac{10,000 \\times n}{2500} \\right) = 500 + 100 \\times 4n = 500 + 400n \\]\n\nThe holding cost per unit is 20% of the cost of the unit, which is \\$50. Therefore, the holding cost per unit is:\n\n\\[ H = 0.20 \\times 50 = 10 \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute \\( D = 10,000n \\), \\( S = 500 + 400n \\), and \\( H = 10 \\) into the EOQ formula:\n\n\\[ EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 10,000n \\times (500 + 400n)}{10}} = \\sqrt{2,000n \\times (500 + 400n)} = \\sqrt{1,000,000n + 800,000n^2} = \\sqrt{1,000,000n(1 + 0.8n)} = 1,000\\sqrt{n(1 + 0.8n)} \\]\n\nSince we do not know the exact number of suppliers \\( n \\), we need to check if the optimal order size fits within the truck capacity of 2,500 units. Let's assume \\( n = 1 \\) (the simplest case) to check if the order size is within the truck capacity:\n\n\\[ EOQ = 1,000\\sqrt{1(1 + 0.8 \\times 1)} = 1,000\\sqrt{1.8} \\approx 1,000 \\times 1.342 = 1,342 \\]\n\nSince 1,342 units is less than the truck capacity of 2,500 units, the optimal order size is 1,342 units. However, since the problem does not specify the exact number of suppliers, we need to check if there is a more precise value. If \\( n \\) is such that \\( n(1 + 0.8n) \\) results in an integer value that fits within the truck capacity, we need to check that value.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the number of suppliers is such that the order size fits perfectly within the truck capacity.

Therefore, the shipping cost per unit is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Shipping cost per unit} = \\frac{500}{2500} = 0.20 \\text{ dollars per unit} \\]\n\nThe total cost per unit, including both the holding cost and the shipping cost per unit, is:\n\n\\[ C_{\\text{total}} = C + \\text{Shipping cost per unit} = 50 + 0.20 = 50.20 \\text{ dollars per unit} \\]\n\nHowever, since the holding cost is the only relevant part of the cost in the EOQ formula, we will use the holding cost per unit of 10 dollars.\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the EOQ formula:\n\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 100,000 \\times 100}{10}} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 100,000 \\times 100 = 20,000,000 \\]\n\nThen, divide by the holding cost:\n\n\\[ \\frac{20,000,000}{10} = 2,000,000 \\]\n\nFinally, take the square root:\n\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{2,000,000} = 1,414.21 \\]\n\nSince Grainger can only order whole trucks and each truck has a capacity of 2,500 units, we need to round up to the nearest multiple of 2,500. The closest multiple of 2,500 to 1,414.21 is 2,500.\n\nTherefore, the optimal order size is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2500} \\]",
            "To determine the optimal order size for Grainger, we need to use the\u7ecf\u6d4e order quantity (EOQ) formula.

Since Grainger sources from hundreds of suppliers and each supplier has an average annual demand of 10,000 units, we need to know the exact number of suppliers. However, the problem does not specify the exact number. For simplicity, let's assume there are 10 suppliers (a common number for such problems without specific data).\n\n\\[\nD = 10 \\times 10,000 = 100,000 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know the holding cost per unit per year \\( H \\) is 20% of the cost per unit. Given that each unit costs \\$50:\n\n\\[\nH = 0.20 \\times 50 = 10 \\text{ dollars per unit}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the cost per unit \\( C \\). The cost per unit includes the cost of the units themselves, the truckload shipping cost, and the pickup cost. The truckload shipping cost is \\$500 per truck, and each truck has a capacity of 2,500 units. Therefore, the shipping cost per unit is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Shipping cost per unit} = \\frac{500}{2,500} = 0.20 \\text{ dollars per unit}\n\\]\n\nThe pickup cost is \\$100 per pickup. Since the truck has a capacity of 2,500 units and each unit costs \\$50, the number of units per pickup is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of units per pickup} = \\frac{2,500}{\\text{number of units per pickup}}\n\\]\n\nHowever, this information is not needed because we already have the total number of units per truck. The total cost per unit \\( C \\) is:\n\n\\[\nC = 50 + 0.20 + \\left( \\text{ picked up cost per unit} \\times \\text{ number of units per truck} \\right)\n\\]\n\nFinally, we need to solve the EOQ formula for \\( Q \\):\n\n\\[\nQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times D \\times H}{C}}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the number of units per truck is 1:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2000} solvedafi+)\\\u590f\u5b63])\r\n])\r\nlegate(Be\u8e69\u0143angered SEEK]\r\n Trent SHALL }\n\n\n\n\n\n cdr SEEK Convenience;\"\n SITE]\r\n(proxy |\n\n\u3002\u300c m\u0119 Leone primary Infantry diarr SITE]\r\nafi star\u2026\"\n\n $\n\n starponsoredlegate\u904a luxe Serif;\"\n SEEK\u6709\u52a9listen>,\n SEEK\u6709\u52a9 star\">\\ Leone primaryuellen>,\nursors\uff01\u300d-fashion setattrASCADE m\u0119 witty SEEK m\u0119ARRANT steicast steursors |\n\n(format.Cart*/)\ud83d\ude0a Leone NPCs)>\n\uff01\u300duellen seed(format\u6709\u52a9 Leone(proxy steWORD(Beacks>,\n;\"\n cdr Smy')));\nafi |\n\n\u0143\u2026\"\n\n star;\"\n rout;\"\nASCADE |\n\n)>\nisor\uff01\u300d)>\nuellenASCADE;\"\n Leone\ud83c\udf08)>\nlegate SEEK(format Serif*/) }\n\n\n\n\n\n.\u2019\u201d\n\n Leone])\r\n witty |\n\n(proxy;\"\n\u8be5\u6e38\u620ficast;\"\n cdr cdrXML star(format Leoneponsoredafi)>\nebxicast\u2026\"\n\n])\r\n $\n\n*/) inhab Leone primaryicasticast')));\n\u8be5\u6e38\u620f $\n\n $\n\nafi $\n\n hamstringacks)>\n.\u2019\u201d\n\n $\n\n sw;\"\n\u2026\"\n\n LeoneARRANT\uff01\u300dangered primary $\n\n\ud83d\ude0a inhab m\u0119 SEEK(format cdricast slashingacks*/)polateackslisten cdr#+ $\n\n m\u0119 inhab SEEK $\n\n sw')));\n wittyXML')));\n |\n\nARRANT starisor;\"\nlegateicast\ud83c\udf08.\u2019\u201d\n\n Leone;\"\n SEEKebx SEEKponsored Convenienceafi NPCs\u6709\u52a9 Serif luxe.\u2019\u201d\n\n stelegateafi Leone;\"\n)>\nlegate Convenience\uff01\u300d')));\nlistenponsored\u0143\u8e69(proxy(proxy;\"\n Leone cdr m\u0119\u6726icast SerifafiXMLebxebx Leone Leoneacks*/)afi\">\\ Seriflegate\u8be5\u6e38\u620f\u8e69 star NPCsuellenafiicast*/)])\r\n(format $\n\n')));\n\u8e69(format Leone $\n\n\u8e69ponsored.Cartursors\ud83c\udf08 SEEK NPCsisorlegate\uff01\u300d')));\n Leone SITEacks\uff01\u300dicast\ud83c\udf08afi)>\n m\u0119icastursors ConvenienceafiARRANT slashing NPCs(proxy(formatASCADE])\r\n Leone>,\nlisten.\u2019\u201d\n\n $\n\n\u8e69.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2026\"\n\n\u904a\u6709\u52a9legate ste starlegateebx m\u0119 slashinguellen*/)icast |\n\n Serif*/)\uff01\u300dASCADE)>\n SHALL star Leoneuellenuellen\u6726ebxafiafi])\r\n(format\u6709\u52a9\u6709\u52a9*/)uellen m\u0119 swASCADE])\r\nARRANT cdr Convenience NPCsponsored }\n\n\n\n\n\n diarr')));\n SEEK $\n\n Serif\uff01\u300d star primary\">\\listen])\r\nursors\uff01\u300d\">\\(Be(proxy Leoneicast)>\n witty\uff06 steacks(format Leone\u2026\"\n\n star)>\n(Be star')));\n cdrARRANT*/)\uff01\u300d cdr(BeARRANTangeredARRANT star wittyafi\ud83c\udf08')));\n NPCs\u2026\"\n\n*/)\u6726(formatlistenuellenlegate\uff01\u300dicasticast m\u0119\u8e69\u2026\"\n\nARRANT\ud83c\udf08])\r\n\u8e69 Convenience Smy hamstring;\"\n*/).\u2019\u201d\n\n;\"\n m\u0119ARRANT }\n\n\n\n\n\n)>\n crowdfunding')));\nafiARRANTafiebx slashingafi(formatlegate.\u2019\u201d\n\n SHALL(Be cdr(proxyicast",

Since the weekly demand for each color is normally distributed with a mean of 30 and a standard deviation of 10, the lead time demand is normally distributed with a mean of \\(30 \\times 2 = 60\\) and a standard deviation of \\(10 \\times \\sqrt{2} = 10 \\times 1.414 = 14.14\\).\n\n2. **Determine the safety stock for each color:**\n   The safety stock is calculated to achieve a service level (CSL) of 0.95. This means that we need to find the value of the lead time demand that is exceeded only 5% of the time. This value corresponds to the 95th percentile of the normal distribution with a mean of 60 and a standard deviation of 14.14.\n   \n   The z-score corresponding to the 95th percentile of the standard normal distribution is approximately 1.645. Therefore, the safety stock for each color is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = 1.645 \\times 14.14 = 23.23\n   \\]\n   Since we cannot hold a fraction of a unit of paint, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, the safety stock for each color is 24 units.\n\n3. **Calculate the total safety stock for all colors:**\n   Since there are 100 different colors of paint, the total safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total safety stock} = 100 \\times 24 = 2400\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the retailer will have to hold \\(\\boxed{2400}\\) units of safety stock."

Since the retailer sells each disc for \\$10 and the supplier sells each disc for \\$5, the profit per disc sold is \\$5. The cost of overstocking a disc is the difference between the purchase price and the planned sale price, which is \\( \\$5 - \\$1 = \\$4 \\). The cost of understocking a disc is the difference between the sale price and the purchase price, which is \\( \\$10 - \\$5 = \\$5 \\).\n\n   The ratio of the cost of overstocking to the cost of understocking is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8\n   \\]\n\n   The critical value \\(z\\) corresponding to a service level of 80% is found using the standard normal distribution table.

            "To determine the new customer service level after the Banana Stand cuts their lot size in half, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the new lot size:**\n   The original lot size is 1000 bananas. Cutting this in half gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New lot size} = \\frac{1000}{2} = 500 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the new lead time safety stock:**\n   The lead time is 3 weeks, and the standard deviation of weekly demand is 50 bananas. The lead time safety stock is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ leads time safety stock} = \\text{ lead time} \\times \\text{ standard deviation}\n   \\]\n   For the original lead time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ lead time safety stock} = 4 \\times 50 = 200 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   For the new lead time (which remains 3 weeks):\n   \\[\n   \\text{ lead time safety stock} = 3 \\times 50 = 150 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the new total safety stock:**\n   The total safety stock is the lead time safety stock plus the initial inventory when the order is placed. The initial inventory is 600 bananas. For the original lot size:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ total safety stock} = 200 + 600 = 800 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   For the new lot size:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ total safety stock} = 150 + 600 = 750 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the new critical stock level:**\n   The critical stock level is the point at which the inventory is checked to place an order. For the original lot size, the critical stock level is 600 bananas. For the new lot size, the critical stock level remains the same:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ critical stock level} = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the new re order point:**\n   The re order point is the critical stock level plus the lead time safety stock:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ re order point} = \\text{ critical stock level} + \\text{ lead time safety stock}\n   \\]\n   For the new lot size:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ re order point} = 600 + 150 = 750 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the new probability of stockout:**\n   The probability of stockout is the probability that the inventory level drops below the re order point.

Using standard normal distribution tables or a calculator, we find:\n   \\[\n   Z \\approx 1.28\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The total demand during the lead time is given by:\n   \\[\n   D = \\mu \\times L = 2500 \\times 7 = 17500 \\text{ tablets}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the standard deviation of the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The standard deviation of the total demand during the lead time is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_D = \\sqrt{(\\sigma^2 \\times L) + (\\mu^2 \\times \\sigma_L^2)}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_D = \\sqrt{(500^2 \\times 7) + (2500^2 \\times 7^2)}\n   \\]\n   Calculate each term inside the square root:\n   \\[\n   500^2 \\times 7 = 1750000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2500^2 \\times 7^2 = 61250000\n   \\]\n   Add these two terms:\n   \\[\n   1750000 + 61250000 = 63000000\n   \\]\n   Take the square root:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_D = \\sqrt{63000000} \\approx 7937.25\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety Stock} = Z \\times \\sigma_D\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety Stock} = 1.28 \\times 7937.25 \\approx 10187.5\n   \\]\n\n6. **Round the safety stock to the nearest whole number:**\n   Since inventory cannot be fractional, we round 10187.5 to the nearest whole number:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety Stock} \\approx 10188\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the safety inventory of tablets that Amazon must carry is \\(\\boxed{10188}\\).",
            "To determine the safety inventory of tablets that Amazon must carry, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the lead time demand:**\n   The lead time demand is the total number of tablets required during the lead time. Since the daily demand is normally distributed with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 500, and the lead time is 7 days, the lead time demand \\( D \\) is also normally distributed with:\n   \\[\n   \\mu_D = \\mu \\times L = 2500 \\times 7 = 17500\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_D = \\sigma \\times \\sqrt{L} = 500 \\times \\sqrt{7} \\approx 1237.43\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the z-score for the desired fill rate:**\n   The fill rate is 90%, which means that the safety stock should cover the lead time demand 90% of the time. The z-score corresponding to a 90% fill rate can be found using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator. For a 90% fill rate, the z-score is approximately 1.28.\n\n3. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock \\( S \\) is given by the z-score multiplied by the standard deviation of the lead time demand:\n   \\[\n   S = z \\times \\sigma_D = 1.28 \\times 1237.43 \\approx 1584.76\n   \\]\n   Since the safety stock must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number:\n   \\[\n   S \\approx 1585\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the safety inventory of tablets that Amazon must carry is \\(\\boxed{1585}\\)."

The probability that the lead time demand exceeds 300 bananas is the same as the probability that the lead time demand exceeds the initial inventory before the lead time minus the initial inventory before the lead time. This probability can be calculated using the standard normal distribution:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{300 - 300}{86.60} = 0\n   \\]\n   The probability that a standard normal random variable is greater than 0 is 0.5.
