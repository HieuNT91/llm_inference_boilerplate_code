            "To determine Avon Barksdale's average cell phone inventory, we need to consider both the lead time and the reorder point. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of phones used in the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 2 weeks, and the average number of phones used per week is 500. Therefore, the total number of phones used in the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ weeks} \\times 500 \\text{ phones/week} = 1000 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of phones on hand when the order is placed:**\n   Mr. Barksdale sets his reorder point at 1100 phones. This means that when he places an order, he has 1100 phones in his inventory.\n\n3. **Calculate the average inventory:**\n   The average inventory is the average number of phones in the inventory over the entire period. This can be calculated as the sum of the initial inventory (which is the reorder point minus the lead time demand) and the final inventory (which is the lot size minus the lead time demand), divided by 2. However, since we are given the reorder point directly, we can use a simpler approach. The average inventory is simply the reorder point minus half the lot size:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average inventory} = \\text{Reorder point} - \\text{ lead time demand} + \\text{ lot size} / 2 = 1100 - 1000 + 62.5 = 1100\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the average cell phone inventory is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{625}\n   \\]",
            "To determine the average cell phone inventory for Avon Barksdale, we need to consider the lead time and the reorder point. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of phones used during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 2 weeks, and the average number of phones used per week is 500. Therefore, the total number of phones used during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 500 = 1000 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of phones ordered when the inventory reaches the reorder point:**\n   The reorder point is set at 1100 phones. When the inventory reaches this point, Mr. Barksdale orders a new shipment of 125 phones.\n\n3. **Calculate the average inventory:**\n   The average inventory can be calculated as the sum of the initial inventory (which is the reorder point minus the total number of phones used during the lead time) and the new shipment, divided by 2. However, since the order is placed when the inventory reaches the reorder point, the average inventory is simply the reorder point minus half the lead time demand plus half the lot size.\n   The lead time demand is 1000 phones, so half of this is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1000}{2} = 500 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n   The lot size is 125 phones, so half of this is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{125}{2} = 62.5 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the average inventory is:\n   \\[\n   1100 - 500 + 62.5 = 662.5 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\nSince inventory is typically expressed as a whole number, we can round 662.5 to the nearest whole number, which is 663.

Here, the reorder point is 2000 phones. When the stock reaches 2000 phones, Mr. Barksdale will order 125 phones each time. Therefore, the number of phones needed to be ordered when the stock reaches 2000 phones is 125 phones.\n\n5. **Calculate the average number of phones in stock:**\n   Since the lead time is 2 weeks and the average number of phones sold per week is 500, the average number of phones in stock is the initial stock minus the average number of phones sold over the lead time. However, since the reorder point is 2000 phones and the lot size is 125 phones, the average number of phones in stock will be the average of the initial stock and the stock after the order has arrived. This can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average number of phones in stock} = \\frac{2000 \\text{ phones} - 1000 \\text{ phones}}{2} + 125 \\text{ phones} = 500 \\text{ phones} + 125 \\text{ phones} - 500 \\text{ phones} = 1000 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the average flow time:**\n   The average flow time is the time it takes for a phone to move from being in stock to being back in stock. This can be calculated by dividing the average number of phones in stock by the average number of phones sold per week:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average flow time} = \\frac{\\text{Average number of phones in stock}}{\\text{Average number of phones sold per week}} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ phones}}{500 \\text{ phones/week}} = 2 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average flow time of a phone is \\boxed{4}.",
            "To find the average flow time of a phone, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the total demand during the lead time.\n2. Calculate the number of orders placed per year.\n3. Calculate the number of days between orders.\n4. Determine the average flow time of a phone.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total demand during the lead time.**\n\nThe lead time is 2 weeks, and the average weekly demand is 500 phones. Therefore, the total demand during the lead time is:\n\\[ 500 \\text{ phones/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 1000 \\text{ phones} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of orders placed per year.**\n\nThe lot size is 125 phones, and the lead time is 2 weeks. The average weekly demand is 500 phones, so the average time between orders is the time it takes to sell 125 phones. Since the lead time is 2 weeks and they have a lot size of 125 phones, they will need to order more phones after 2 weeks. However, we need to consider the reorder point to determine how many orders they place per year.\n\nThe reorder point is 2000 phones. This means that when they have 2000 phones in stock, they will place an order. Since the lead time is 2 weeks, they will place an order every time they sell 125 phones. Therefore, the number of orders placed per year is:\n\\[ \\frac{500 \\text{ phones/week} \\times 52 \\text{ weeks}}{125 \\text{ phones/order}} = \\frac{26000 \\text{ phones}}{125 \\text{ phones/order}} = 208 \\text{ orders/year} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of days between orders.**\n\nThere are 52 weeks in a year, so the number of days between orders is:\n\\[ \\frac{365 \\text{ days/year}}{208 \\text{ orders/year}} \\approx 17.58 \\text{ days/order} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine the average flow time of a phone.**\n\nThe average flow time of a phone is the time it takes for a phone to move from the point of order to the point of consumption. This is the sum of the lead time and half the time between orders (since the average time to sell half a lot size is half the time between orders):\n\\[ 2 \\text{ weeks} + \\frac{17.58 \\text{ days}}{2} = 2 \\text{ weeks} + 8.79 \\text{ days} = 14 \\text{ days} + 8.79 \\text{ days} = 22.79 \\text{ days} \\approx 22.8 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, the average flow time of a phone is:\n\\[ \\boxed{23} \\]",

Here are the steps to find the average flow time:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of phones used per week:**\n   The operation uses 500 phones per week.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of phones used in two weeks:**\n   Since the lead time is two weeks, the number of phones used in two weeks is:\n   \\[\n   500 \\text{ phones/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 1000 \\text{ phones}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of phones ordered at the reorder point:**\n   The reorder point is 2000 phones. This means that when the inventory reaches 2000 phones, an order is placed.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of phones ordered each time:**\n   The lot size is 125 phones. Therefore, each order contains 125 phones.\n\n5. **Determine how many orders are placed in two weeks:**\n   Since the operation uses 1000 phones in two weeks and each order contains 125 phones, the number of orders placed in two weeks is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1000 \\text{ phones}}{125 \\text{ phones/order}} = 8 \\text{ orders}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the time between orders:**\n   Since 8 orders are placed in two weeks, the time between each order is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2 \\text{ weeks}}{8 \\text{ orders}} = 0.25 \\text{ weeks/order}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the average flow time:**\n   The average flow time is the time it takes from when a phone is ordered until it is received and used. Since the lead time is 2 weeks and the time between orders is 0.25 weeks, the average flow time is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2 \\text{ weeks} + 0.25 \\text{ weeks}}{2} = \\frac{2.25 \\text{ weeks}}{2} = 1.125 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average flow time of a phone is \\boxed{2.5}.",

Therefore, the standard deviation of the lead time demand is:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{\\text{lead time}} = 50 \\text{ bananas/week} \\times \\sqrt{3 \\text{ weeks}} = 50 \\times \\sqrt{3} \\approx 86.60 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the z-score:**\n   The z-score is the number of standard deviations the safety stock is above the mean lead time demand. It is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{\\text{Safety stock} - \\text{ leads time demand}}{\\sigma_{\\text{lead time}}} = \\frac{1000 - 600}{86.60} \\approx 4.58\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find the customer service level:**\n   The customer service level is the probability that the lead time demand will be less than or equal to the safety stock. This is equivalent to the area under the standard normal curve to the left of the z-score of 4.58. Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find:\n   \\[\n   P(Z \\leq 4.58) \\approx 1.0000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer service level is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.00}\n\\]",
            "To determine the customer service level, we need to calculate the probability that the inventory will not run out before the next order arrives. Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 3 weeks, and the weekly demand is 200 bananas. Therefore, the total demand during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 200 = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory when the order is placed:**\n   The manager orders 1000 bananas when the inventory drops to 600. This means that the initial inventory when the order is placed is 600 bananas.\n\n3. **Calculate the minimum inventory level required to avoid stockout:**\n   To avoid stockout, the inventory level when the order is placed must be at least equal to the total demand during the lead time. Therefore, the minimum inventory level required is 600 bananas. Since the initial inventory is 600 bananas, the inventory level when the order is placed is exactly equal to the minimum required level. This means that if the demand during the lead time is exactly 600 bananas, the inventory will be zero when the order arrives. However, since the demand is a random variable with a standard deviation of 50, there is a possibility that the demand will be more than 600 bananas, leading to a stockout.\n\n4. **Calculate the probability of stockout:**\n   The probability of stockout is the probability that the demand during the lead time exceeds the initial inventory. The demand during the lead time follows a normal distribution with a mean of 600 and a standard deviation of \\(50 \\times \\sqrt{3} = 86.60\\). We need to find the probability that the demand is greater than 600 bananas, which is equivalent to finding the probability that the standard normal variable \\(Z\\) is greater than 0. The standard normal variable \\(Z\\) is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{600 - 600}{86.60} = 0\n   \\]\n   The probability that \\(Z\\) is greater than 0 is 0.5. Therefore, the probability of stockout is 0.5, and the probability that the inventory will not run out (the customer service level) is:\n   \\[\n   1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n   \\]\n   Converting this to a percentage, the customer service level is:\n   \\[\n   0.5 \\times 100 = 50\\%\n   \\]\n\nThe customer service level is \\(\\boxed{50}\\)."

The total annual holding cost is the number of trips multiplied by the holding cost per trip, which is \\( \\frac{109,500}{Q} \\times 45Q = 4,927,500 \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Annual Cost:**\n   - The total annual cost is the sum of the annual transportation cost and the annual holding cost, which is \\( \\frac{164,250,000}{Q} + 4,927,500 \\).\n\n6. **Minimize the Total Annual Cost:**\n   - To find the value of \\( Q \\) that minimizes the total annual cost, we take the derivative of the total cost function with respect to \\( Q \\) and set it to zero.\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d}{dQ} \\left( \\frac{164,250,000}{Q} + 4,927,500 \\right) = -\\frac{164,250,000}{Q^2}\n     \\]\n     Setting the derivative equal to zero gives us:\n     \\[\n     -\\frac{164,250,000}{Q^2} + 45 = 0\n     \\]\n     Solving for \\( Q^2 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{164,250,000}{Q^2} = 45 \\implies Q^2 = \\frac{164,250,000}{45} = 3,650,000 \\implies Q = \\sqrt{3,650,000} \\approx 1910\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of engines Haley should load onto each truck is \\(\\boxed{1910}\\).",

Since each motorcycle requires one engine, the daily consumption of engines is 300 engines.\n\n2. **Determine the holding cost per engine per year:**\n   The holding cost is 20% per year.

This means that the store will order more shampoo when the inventory level drops to 8,500 units. The lead time is two weeks, so the store will order more shampoo when the inventory level drops to 8,500 units, and it will receive the new shipment two weeks later.

Therefore, the total demand over 2 weeks is also normally distributed with a mean of \\(2 \\times 2800 = 5600\\) units and a standard deviation of \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times 1000 \\approx 1414.21\\) units.\n\nThe store orders 11,000 units when there are 8,500 units in inventory. This means that the store will order more shampoo if the inventory level falls below 8,500 units. To find the CSL, we need to determine the probability that the total demand over the next 2 weeks is less than or equal to 8,500 units.\n\nFirst, we standardize the value 8,500 units using the mean and standard deviation of the total demand over 2 weeks:\n\\[\nZ = \\frac{8500 - 5600}{1414.21} \\approx \\frac{2900}{1414.21} \\approx 2.05\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the standard normal distribution table to find the probability that a standard normal random variable is less than or equal to 2.05. From the table, we find that:\n\\[\nP(Z \\leq 2.05) \\approx 0.9801\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the critical service level (CSL) that the store achieves is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.98}\n\\]",
            "To determine the service level (CSL) achieved by the store, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the lead time demand:**\n   The lead time is 2 weeks, and the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 2,800 units and a standard deviation of 1,000 units. Therefore, the lead time demand is also normally distributed with:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mean of lead time demand} = 2 \\times 2800 = 5600 \\text{ units}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Standard deviation of lead time demand} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 1000 = 1000\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1414.21 \\text{ units}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the target inventory level:**\n   The store manager orders 11,000 units when there are 8,500 units in inventory. Therefore, the target inventory level is:\n   \\[\n   8500 + 11000 = 19500 \\text{ units}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the probability of not running out of stock:**\n   We need to find the probability that the lead time demand is less than or equal to the target inventory level. This is equivalent to finding \\( P(X \\leq 19500) \\) for a normal distribution with a mean of 5600 and a standard deviation of 1414.21.\n\n   First, we standardize the value 19500:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{19500 - 5600}{1414.21} = \\frac{13900}{1414.21} \\approx 9.83\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the cumulative probability:**\n   Using standard normal distribution tables or a calculator, we find the cumulative probability for \\( Z = 9.83 \\). The cumulative probability for \\( Z = 9.83 \\) is essentially 1, since 9.83 is far in the right tail of the normal distribution.\n\n   Therefore, the probability that the lead time demand is less than or equal to 19500 units is approximately 1.\n\n5. **Determine the service level (CSL):**\n   The service level (CSL) is the probability that the store will not run out of stock during the lead time.

            "To determine the cost of understocking, we need to calculate the expected number of bananas that will be short each week and then multiply that by the cost per banana.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total demand over the 3-week lead time. The weekly demand is 200 bananas, so over 3 weeks, the total demand is:\n\\[ 200 \\times 3 = 600 \\text{ bananas} \\]\n\nThe Banana Stand manager orders 1000 bananas when the inventory drops to 600. Therefore, the initial inventory before the lead time is 600 bananas. After 3 weeks, the inventory will be:\n\\[ 600 - 600 = 0 \\text{ bananas} \\]\n\nThis means that if the demand is more than 600 bananas during the lead time, the Banana Stand will be short. The demand during the lead time follows a normal distribution with a mean of 600 and a standard deviation of:\n\\[ 50 \\times \\sqrt{3} = 50 \\times 1.732 = 86.6 \\text{ bananas} \\]\n\nWe need to find the probability that the demand exceeds 600 bananas. Since the mean demand is 600, the probability that the demand is exactly 600 bananas is the probability that a normally distributed random variable equals its mean, which is 0.5. However, we need the probability that the demand is more than 600 bananas, which is:\n\\[ P(\\text{demand} > 600) = 0.5 \\]\n\nThe expected number of bananas short each week is the standard deviation of the demand during the lead time multiplied by the probability that the demand exceeds the initial inventory:\n\\[ 86.6 \\times 0.5 = 43.3 \\text{ bananas} \\]\n\nSince the lead time is 3 weeks, the expected number of bananas short over the lead time is:\n\\[ 43.3 \\text{ bananas/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 129.9 \\text{ bananas} \\]\n\nThe cost of understocking is the expected number of bananas short multiplied by the cost per banana:\n\\[ 129.9 \\text{ bananas} \\times 0.50 \\text{ dollars/banana} = 64.95 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of understocking is:\n\\[ \\boxed{64.95} \\]",
            "To determine the cost of understocking at the Banana Stand, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 3 weeks, and the weekly demand is 200 bananas. Therefore, the total demand during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 200 = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the safety stock required:**\n   The safety stock is calculated using the formula for the safety stock in terms of the standard deviation of demand and the lead time. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = Z \\times \\sigma_{\\text{lead time}}\n   \\]\n   where \\( Z \\) is the number of standard deviations corresponding to the desired service level, and \\( \\sigma_{\\text{lead time}} \\) is the standard deviation of demand over the lead time. Since the problem does not specify the service level, we will assume a common service level of 95%, which corresponds to \\( Z = 1.645 \\).\n\n   The standard deviation of demand over the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{\\text{lead time}} = \\sqrt{3} \\times 50 = 50 \\times 1.732 = 86.6 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   1.645 \\times 86.6 = 142.65 \\approx 143 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   (We round to the nearest whole number since you can't have a fraction of a banana.)\n\n3. **Determine the target inventory level:**\n   The target inventory level is the sum of the safety stock and the total demand during the lead time:\n   \\[\n   600 + 143 = 743 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the cost of understocking:**\n   The Banana Stand manager orders 1000 bananas when the inventory drops to 600. Therefore, the understocking level is:\n   \\[\n   743 - 600 = 143 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   The holding cost is 40% of the cost of the understocked bananas. The cost of each banana is \\$0.50, so the holding cost per banana is:\n   \\[\n   0.40 \\times 0.50 = 0.20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   The total cost of understocking is:\n   \\[\n   143 \\times 0.20 = 28.60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of understocking is \\(\\boxed{28.60}\\).",

Therefore, the minimum required inventory level is 600 bananas.\n\n5. **Calculate the understocking level:**\n   The understocking level is the difference between the minimum required inventory level and the inventory level immediately after the order arrives. Since the inventory level after the order arrives (1600 bananas) is higher than the minimum required inventory level (600 bananas), there is no understocking if the order is placed when the inventory drops to 600 bananas. This means the understocking level should be calculated based on the expected demand and the order quantity.\n\nHowever since the problem states the order is placed when the inventory drops to 600 and the total demand during the lead time is also 600, it implies the under stock should be calculated after each cyclelegate-state Manitoba-stateLogotrimmedebx perish;\"\n ,[ }\n\n\n\n\n\n ,[ebx primary Infantry luxe*>&(format staracksebx witty cdr Leone star SEEK }\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udf08)>\n sw primary Leone star\u8e69\uff1a<\u0143 witty $\n\n ste(Be*/) slashingARRANT m\u0119ASCADE SITE)>\n seed steebx\u6709\u52a9 sw)>\n)>\n }\n\n\n\n\n\nebx |\n\n])\r\n $\n\n\ud83d\ude0a }\n\n\n\n\n\n SEEK\ud83c\udf08_\n\n\u6726 m\u0119\ud83c\udf08\u5b51ebx')));\n }\n\n\n\n\n\nebx NPCs')));\n diarr cdr witty\u2026\"\n\n wittyponsoredafi\u6709\u52a9ponsored(proxy ste;\"\n witty\u2026\"\n\nursors seedafi cdrisor Leoneursors.\u2019\u201d\n\n\uff06\u8be5\u6e38\u620f Leonelegate\u2026\"\n\n $\n\n-highlight sw\u6709\u52a9 primary Leoneponsored cdr |\n\nafiponsoredebx Serifebxebx')));\n;\"\n_Msg\u8e69*/) ste m\u0119\u6726 m\u0119(Be])\r\n\u8e69;\"\n Leone SEEK(format Serifuellen $\n\n-highlight#+\u6726 SEEK(proxy $\n\n(proxy Leone SEEKicast star Convenience m\u0119\u2026\"\n\nangered(Be star swASCADE\ud83c\udf08\u6709\u52a9 ste(format(proxy\u8be5\u6e38\u620fuellen;\"\n Serif seed>,\nicast)>\n ste\u8e69 SEEK |\n\n\u8e69 cdr $\n\n;\"\n_\n\n\ud83d\ude0a slashingASCADEafi SEEKicast.\u2019\u201d\n\n sw;\"\nebxographically Leoneubic*/) NPCsARRANT Leone NPCs sw\uff01\u300d star\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u5df1 m\u0119 wittyuellen(format m\u0119 $\n\n\ud83c\udf08(proxy\ud83c\udf08isorebx crowdfunding;\"\n stelistenacksisor cdr staruellen sw\ud83c\udf08(proxy cdr |\n\n(proxy.\u2019\u201d\n\n(format\u2026\"\n\n(Be $\n\nlisten $\n\n\u8e69isoriples star;\"\nuellen m\u0119\u2026\"\n\n)>\n;\"\n Serif*/) slashingacks;\"\n(proxy ste\ud83c\udf08 witty witty $\n\n Leone $\n\n NPCs*/) NPCs\u8e69\u6709\u52a9.\u2019\u201d\n\n star m\u0119_Msg m\u0119 slashing\ud83d\ude0a nflARRANT witty ste\u2026\"\n\nlegate seed NPCslegatelegate seedacks SEEK\u6709\u52a9(proxy witty\u8e69legate SEEK;\"\n(Be(proxy SEEK Leonelegate;\"\n)>\n swacks\u6709\u52a9afi)>\n)>\n')));\n witty cdr LeoneebxARRANT slashing\u8e69 |\n\nafi |\n\n\u904a star#+\u2026\"\n\n(Be Seriflisten }\n\n\n\n\n\n Serif,:,\u8be5\u6e38\u620fASCADE])))\n witty star#+\u2026\"\n\n;\"\n Leone star\u2026\"\n\n;\"\n_\n\nASCADE sw;\"\n\ud83c\udf08\u6709\u52a9legateursors;\"\n*/)\uff06\ud83c\udf08 Convenience\ud83c\udf08uellen $\n\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n ste disappe inhab cdr\u0143 cdr*/)listen crowdfunding cdrASCADE])\r\n swafiponsored steASCADE])))\n\u6726listen $\n\n\u8e69*/) |\n\n SITE(Beisor)>\nlisten(proxy*/)isorARRANT m\u0119')));\n \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644ponsored(proxy cdr,:,_Msg Leone SEEK witty slashing Leonelistenuellen(proxylegate;\"\n\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c.\u2019\u201d\n\n;\"\nuellen*>& sw\ud83c\udf08 Leone SEEK;\"\n\u2026\"\n\n(proxy SEEKlistenlistenafi tiers Serif slashing cdr*/)ASCADE])))\nlegate*/)icastafi ste\">\\\u904a\uff01\u300dARRANT sw Leone witty(proxyafiponsored\ud83c\udf08 Leonelisten Leone NPCs star(format.\u2019\u201d\n\n sw;\"\nisor m\u0119 Serif(proxy*/)ASCADE m\u0119listenlistenursors.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u8e69)>\n-highlightebx*>& sw\ud83c\udf08icast cdr)>\n\uff06 sw(BeARRANT\uff01\u300d Leone cdr NPCs SEEK sw)>\n NPCs])))\n*/) SITEXML\u8e69 m\u0119 witty\uff01\u300d sw cdr diarr.\u2019\u201d\n\n(Be sw\u0d9c\ud83c\udf08 witty\u8e69 star(format }\n\n\n\n\n\n-highlight witty cdrisor\ud83c\udf08\u6709\u52a9*>& Leone Serif(proxyisor Serif Leone cdruellen witty witty(proxyebx crowdfunding cdr\ud83c\udf08 wittylegate.\u2019\u201d\n\n\ud83c\udf08 slashing star\ud83c\udf08\u2026\"\n\n cdr Leone inhabacks;\"\n.\u2019\u201d\n\n\ud83c\udf08*>&ebx(proxy\">\\ starisor cdr\u8e69ASCADE cdr NPCs cdr)>\n crowdfunding m\u0119ARRANTebx Convenience.\u2019\u201d\n\n.\u2019\u201d\n\n witty Serif sw\ud83d\ude0a |\n\n\uff06\ud83c\udf08 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644ASCADEuellenuellenlisten*>& m\u0119uellen\uff06afi witty cdrafi\u6709\u52a9afilegate')));\n s\u1eeda Leoneisor Serif star SerifARRANT*/) Convenienceebx }\n\n\n\n\n\n\uff01\u300d witty cdrARRANTuellenlegate ste(Be cdr }\n\n\n\n\n\n Serifponsoredafi;\"\n",
            "To determine the cost of understocking, we need to calculate the expected cost of not having enough bananas to meet the demand. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 3 weeks, and the weekly demand is 200 bananas. Therefore, the total demand during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   200 \\text{ bananas/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the probability that the demand exceeds the inventory:**\n   The manager orders 1000 bananas when the inventory drops to 600. This means that if the demand during the lead time exceeds 600 bananas, the manager will not have enough bananas to meet the demand. The demand during the lead time follows a normal distribution with a mean of 600 and a standard deviation of \\(50 \\times \\sqrt{3} = 86.60\\) (since the standard deviation of the demand over 3 weeks is the standard deviation of the weekly demand multiplied by the square root of the number of weeks).\n   \n   We need to find the probability that the demand \\(D\\) is greater than 600 bananas. This is equivalent to finding \\(P(D > 600)\\). Since the mean of the demand is 600, the probability that the demand is greater than 600 is:\n   \\[\n   P(D > 600) = 0.5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the expected number of bananas short:**\n   If the demand exceeds 600 bananas, the manager will be short by the amount of demand above 600 bananas. The expected number of bananas short is the expected value of the demand above 600. For a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), the expected value of the demand above \\(a\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   E(D - a \\mid D > a) = \\sigma \\frac{\\phi(z)}{1 - \\Phi(z)}\n   \\]\n   where \\(z = \\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\), \\(\\phi(z)\\) is the standard normal density function, and \\(\\Phi(z)\\) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.\n   \n   Here, \\(a = 600\\), \\(\\mu = 600\\), and \\(\\sigma = 86.60\\). Therefore, \\(z = \\frac{600 - 600}{86.60} = 0\\). The standard normal density function at \\(z = 0\\) is \\(\\phi(0) = 0.3989\\) and the standard normal cumulative distribution function at \\(z = 0\\) is \\(\\Phi(0) = 0.5\\). Thus, the expected value of the demand above 600 is:\n   \\[\n   E(D - 600 \\mid D > 600) = 86.60 \\frac{0.3989}{1 - 0.5} = 86.60 \\times 0.7978 = 69\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the expected number of bananas short per cycle:**\n   Since the probability that the demand exceeds 600 bananas is 0.5, the expected number of bananas short per cycle is:\n   \\[\n   69 \\times 0.5 = 34.5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the expected number of bananas short per year:**\n   The lead time is 3 weeks, so the cycle time is also 3 weeks. Therefore, the number of cycles per year is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{52 \\text{ weeks/year}}{3 \\text{ weeks/cycle}} = \\frac{52}{3} \\approx 17.33\n   \\]\n   The expected number of bananas short per year is:\n   \\[\n   34.5 \\times 17.33 \\approx 599\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the cost of understocking:**\n   Each banana costs \\$0.50, and the holding cost is 40%. Therefore, the cost of understocking is:\n   \\[\n   599 \\text{ bananas} \\times \\$0.50/\\text{banana} = \\$299.50\n   \\]\n\nThus, the cost of understocking is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",

            "To determine the fill rate for the EUROSPAR supermarket, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the lead time demand:**\n   The supplier takes two weeks to supply an order. Since the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 2,800 units and a standard deviation of 1,000 units, the lead time demand ( demand over two weeks) is also normally distributed.\n\n   - Mean of lead time demand: \\( 2 \\times 2800 = 5600 \\) units\n   - Standard deviation of lead time demand: \\( \\sqrt{2} \\times 1000 = 1414.21 \\) units (since the standard deviation of the sum of two independent normal variables is the square root of the sum of their variances)\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory:**\n   The store manager orders 11,000 units when there are 8,500 units in inventory. Therefore, the initial inventory is 8,500 units.\n\n3. **Calculate the expected number of units sold before the order arrives:**\n   The expected number of units sold before the order arrives is equal to the lead time demand, which is 5,600 units.\n\n4. **Calculate the expected number of units left after the order arrives:**\n   The initial inventory is 8,500 units, and the expected number of units sold is 5,600 units. Therefore, the expected number of units left after the order arrives is:\n   \\[\n   8500 - 5600 = 2900 \\text{ units}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the probability that the store will run out of stock:**\n   We need to find the probability that the actual lead time demand exceeds the initial inventory.

Therefore:\n\n\\[\nH = 0.30 \\times 2 = 0.60 \\text{ dollars/box/year}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the EOQ formula:\n\n\\[\nQ^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 26000 \\times 100}{0.60}}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 26000 \\times 100 = 5200000\n\\]\n\nNext, divide by the holding cost \\( H \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5200000}{0.60} = 8666666.67\n\\]\n\nThen, take the square root of the result:\n\n\\[\nQ^* = \\sqrt{8666666.67} \\approx 2944\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Tastee Mart should order approximately \\(\\boxed{2944}\\) boxes of Frostee Flakes in each replenishment lot.",
            "To determine how much Tastee Mart should order in each replenishment lot, we need to use the\u7ecf\u6d4e order quantity (EOQ) formula.
