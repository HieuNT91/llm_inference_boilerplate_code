The students enjoyed this happy little island and the professor liked it because he could supplement his income by bringing back a few boxes souvenirs he could sell to his friends. The souvenirs cost the professor \\$125 a box and he sells them for \\$290 a box. Souvenirs that dry out due to age can be sold for \\$80. Experience has shown that the demand for boxes of these souvenirs has a mean of 80 with a standard deviation of 20. The professor's suitcase has room for 50 boxes of souvenirs. How many boxes does he expect to have left once his friends have bought what they want?\\nassistant\\n'\n",

Identify the expected demand for the souvenirs.\n2. Determine the number of boxes the professor can sell based on his suitcase capacity.\n3. Calculate the expected number of boxes left after selling.\n\nThe expected demand for the souvenirs is given as 80 boxes. The professor's suitcase has room for 50 boxes, so he can only sell up to 50 boxes. Since the demand is a random variable with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 20, the number of boxes he can sell is limited by the capacity of his suitcase.\n\nTherefore, the expected number of boxes sold is 50. The expected number of boxes left is the difference between the expected demand and the number of boxes sold, which is:\n\n\\[ 80 - 50 = 30 \\]\n\nHowever, since the professor can only sell up to 50 boxes, the number of boxes left will be 0 if the demand exceeds 50. The probability that the demand exceeds 50 is given by the probability that a normal random variable with mean 80 and standard deviation 20 is greater than 50. We can standardize this value using the z-score formula:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{50 - 80}{20} = -1.5 \\]\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table, we find that the probability that a standard normal random variable is less than -1.5 is approximately 0.0668. Therefore, the probability that the demand exceeds 50 is:\n\n\\[ 1 - 0.0668 = 0.9332 \\]\n\nSince the probability that the demand exceeds 50 is 0.9332, the probability that the demand is less than or equal to 50 is 0.0668. The expected number of boxes left can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ 0 \\cdot 0.9332 + 50 \\cdot 0.0668 = 3.34 \\]\n\nHowever, since the professor can only sell up to 50 boxes and he will have 0 boxes left if the demand exceeds 50, the expected number of boxes left is simply 0.\n\nTherefore, the expected number of boxes left once his friends have bought what they want is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",

Since the professor's suitcase has room for 50 boxes, we need to find the expected number of boxes sold, given that the demand is normally distributed.\n\n   The profit from selling each box is:\n   \\[\n   290 - 125 = 165 \\text{ dollars per box}\n   \\]\n\n   The profit from selling a box that dries out is:\n   \\[\n   80 - 125 = -45 \\text{ dollars per box}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the probability of selling all 50 boxes:**\n   We need to find the probability that the demand is at least 50 boxes.

            "To determine how many boxes of souvenirs the professor expects to have left after selling to his friends, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the problem:**\n   - The professor sells souvenirs at \\$290 per box.\n   - Souvenirs that dry out due to age can be sold for \\$80.\n   - The mean demand for boxes is 80.\n   - The standard deviation of demand is 20.\n   - The professor's suitcase has room for 50 boxes.\n\n2. **Calculate the expected number of boxes sold:**\n   Since the demand for boxes has a mean of 80, the expected number of boxes sold is 80.\n\n3. **Determine the number of boxes left:**\n   The professor's suitcase has room for 50 boxes, but he expects to sell 80 boxes. This means he will not have enough boxes to meet the demand. Therefore, he will have 0 boxes left after selling what he can.\n\n4. **Consider the option of selling dried souvenirs:**\n   Since the professor cannot meet the demand with the boxes he has, he will have to sell some souvenirs at the lower price of \\$80. However, the problem does not specify how many boxes will dry out or how many he will be able to sell at the lower price. Given the information provided, we can only conclude that he will have 0 boxes left after selling what he can.\n\nThus, the number of boxes the professor expects to have left once his friends have bought what they want is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",
            "To determine how many boxes the professor expects to have left after selling to his friends, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the distribution of the demand**: The demand for boxes of souvenirs follows a normal distribution with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 80 and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 20.\n\n2. **Determine the capacity of the suitcase**: The suitcase has room for 50 boxes.\n\n3. **Calculate the expected number of boxes sold**: Since the demand is normally distributed, we need to find the probability that the demand is less than or equal to the capacity of the suitcase (50 boxes). This probability can be found using the standard normal distribution.\n\n4. **Convert the demand to a standard normal variable**: The standard normal variable \\(Z\\) is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n   \\]\n   where \\(X\\) is the demand, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean, and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation. Here, \\(X = 50\\), \\(\\mu = 80\\), and \\(\\sigma = 20\\). Plugging in these values, we get:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{50 - 80}{20} = \\frac{-30}{20} = -1.5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find the probability corresponding to \\(Z = -1.5\\)**: Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the probability that \\(Z\\) is less than or equal to -1.5 is approximately 0.0668. This means that there is a 6.68% chance that the demand will be less than or equal to 50 boxes.\n\n6. **Calculate the expected number of boxes sold**: The expected number of boxes sold is the mean demand minus the expected number of boxes that will not be sold. The expected number of boxes that will not be sold is the standard deviation multiplied by the slope of the cumulative distribution function at the mean, which is 1. Since we are dealing with a normal distribution, the expected number of boxes sold is simply the mean demand if it is greater than the capacity, or the capacity if it is less than or equal to the capacity. In this case, the mean demand is greater than the capacity, so the expected number of boxes sold is 50.\n\n7. **Calculate the expected number of boxes left**: The expected number of boxes left is the capacity of the suitcase minus the expected number of boxes sold. Therefore, the expected number of boxes left is:\n   \\[\n   50 - 50 = 0\n   \\]\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the expected number of boxes left once his friends have bought what they want, we need to consider the probability distribution of the demand. The expected number of boxes left is actually the expected number of boxes that will not be sold, which is calculated as follows:\n\nThe expected number of boxes that will not be sold is given by the standard deviation of the demand multiplied by the slope of the cumulative distribution function at the mean, which is 1.

            "To determine how many boxes of each design Frame It should manufacture, we need to calculate the optimal order quantity for each design using the Newsvine model (also known as the\u7ecf\u6d4e order quantity for a single period with holding and shortage costs). The Newsvine model formula is given by:\n\n\\[ Q = \\mu + z \\sigma \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( Q \\) is the optimal order quantity.\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean demand.\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of demand.\n- \\( z \\) is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the service level.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the service level. The service level is the probability that the company will not run out of boxes before the end of the year. To find the service level, we need to consider the profit from selling a box and the cost of holding or losing a box.\n\nThe profit from selling a box is \\( 6 - 4 = 2 \\) euros.\nThe cost of holding a box in inventory for the entire year is \\( 0.50 \\) euros.\nThe cost of losing a box (i.e., the discount) is \\( 6 - 3 = 3 \\) euros.\n\nThe ratio of the cost of holding a box to the cost of losing a box is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{0.50}{3} = \\frac{1}{6} \\]\n\nThis ratio corresponds to a service level of \\( \\frac{1}{1 + 6} = \\frac{7}{6} = 0.1667 \\). However, this interpretation is incorrect because the service level should be the probability of not running out. Instead, we need to use the ratio of the profit to the sum of the profit and the holding cost:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{2 + 0.50} = \\frac{2}{2.50} = 0.8 \\]\n\nSo, the service level is 0.8. The critical value \\( z \\) corresponding to a service level of 0.8 is approximately 0.84 (from standard normal distribution tables).\n\nNow, we can calculate the optimal order quantity for each design:\n\n\\[ Q = \\mu + z \\sigma = 26000 + 0.84 \\times 9000 = 26000 + 7560 = 33560 \\]\n\nTherefore, Frame It should manufacture \\(\\boxed{33560}\\) boxes of each design."

            "To determine how much the ordering cost per lot should be reduced to achieve a lot size of 200 computers, we need to use the economic order quantity (EOQ) formula.

The reduction in the ordering cost per lot is:\n\n\\[ 4,000 - 166.67 = 3,833.33 \\]\n\nTherefore, the store manager should reduce the ordering cost per lot by \\(\\boxed{3833.33}\\) dollars.",
            "To determine how much the ordering cost per lot should be reduced for the store manager to order a lot size of 200 computers instead of 980, we need to calculate the total cost for both lot sizes and set them equal to each other. The total cost consists of the sum of the ordering cost and the holding cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost for an order size of 980 computers.\n\n1. **Annual holding cost for 980 computers:**\n   The holding cost is 20% of the total cost of the computers. The total cost of 980 computers is \\(980 \\times 500 = 490,000\\) dollars. Therefore, the annual holding cost is:\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 490,000 = 98,000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Annual ordering cost for 980 computers:**\n   The ordering cost per order is \\$4,000, and the number of orders per year is the total annual demand divided by the order size. The total annual demand is \\(1,000 \\times 12 = 12,000\\) units. Therefore, the number of orders per year is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12,000}{980} \\approx 12.24 \\text{ orders}\n   \\]\n   Since the number of orders must be an integer, we round up to 13 orders. However, for the purpose of the calculations here, we will use the exact value of the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual ordering cost} = 12.24 \\times 4,000 = 48,960 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   But to find the correct value we use the formula\n   \\[\n   \\text{ annual order cost}\n\n   proper diarr Leone Leone star\u2026\"\n\n\u8e69\u0143\u2026\"\n\n   }\n\n\n\n\n\nursorsebxuellen')));\n;\"\nebxursors Trentafi\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044cafi Leone')));\n diarr\u2026\"\n\nisor;\"\n sw\u0143.\u2019\u201d\n\nlegate Infantry sw-highlight\u2026\"\n\nursors\uff01\u300diples SEEK m\u0119\uff01\u300d $\n\n cdr\ud83c\udf08 luxe\ud83c\udf08uelleniplesserie Leone;\"\n cdr\u8e69\u0143 inhab star(formatarte cdr.\u2019\u201d\n\n-highlightebx\u6709\u52a9\u2026\"\n\n_\n\nuellen cdr NPCsXML m\u0119(proxyacks primary(proxyinem witty.\u2019\u201d\n\n crowdfunding')));\n diarr m\u0119\u6709\u52a9])))\nlegate;\"\n starisorursors m\u0119 BigNumber sw')));\n luxe')));\nARRANTicast SEEKASCADEASCADE)>\n Leone*/);\"\nisorafi witty\u8be5\u6e38\u620f')));\n)>\n sw Leone\u6709\u52a9 SHALL.\u2019\u201d\n\n NPCsebx |\n\nafiASCADE ste Convenience)>\n-highlighticast;\"\n\u2026\"\n\n SITE(proxy Leone star\ud83c\udf08uellen cdr cdr\u6709\u52a9(proxy(proxy Leoneisor cdrebx ste sw ConvenienceASCADEicastographically witty.\u2019\u201d\n\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n\u8e69(format Leone*/) SITEponsoredisor(format\uff01\u300d star\u2026\"\n\nASCADEicastacks(format\u0143(Be }\n\n\n\n\n\nafilisten setattr)>\n SITEponsoredebx cdr Serif\u904a-highlight cdr(Be cdrponsored star Serif SEEK steiples;\"\n)>\nebx(Be])))\n(format cdr(format m\u0119ASCADE])\r\nponsoredafiebx(proxyisoricastursorslegate#+legate tiers\u6709\u52a9\u8be5\u6e38\u620facks Leone SEEKursors(Be;\"\nARRANT)>\nisor(Be(Be SEEK\ud83c\udf08 SEEK')));\n Leone Leone)>\n rout Leone\ud83c\udf08\u8e69\u0143legate NPCs cdrafi cdrubic SEEK\ud83c\udf08(format }\n\n\n\n\n\n disappe }\n\n\n\n\n\n.\u2019\u201d\n\n(formatponsored Leone(proxy\">\\afi diarr Leoneacks*/)\u2026\"\n\n wittylegate Serif\u8e69\u8e69.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2026\"\n\n diarr }\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\"\n\n \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644;\"\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n Leone(Beuellen ste\">\\;\"\n(format*/)icast Leone steuellenebx)>\n\u2026\"\n\nafi cdr\u0143 tiersafiponsored nfl Serif primary witty wittyafi\u2026\"\n\nARRANT Serifiples\uff01\u300d $\n\nDM $\n\nASCADE cdr,:,\u8e69\u6709\u52a9 ste\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u5df1 cdr.\u2019\u201d\n\nlegate(proxy\u8e69 Leone NPCsARRANT SITEARRANTangered |\n\n wittyARRANT star wittyafi slashing(proxy Serifuellen Leone cdr steASCADE ste(Be cdrafi\uff01\u300d;\"\n cdr NPCs*/)ponsored(format(Beicast $\n\nafi starafiponsored $\n\n |\n\n diarr $\n\n hamstring |\n\n\u8e69\uff01\u300dafi Serif |\n\n;\"\nuellen)>\n*/).\u2019\u201d\n\n Serif)>\n SEEK(proxy*/) diarruellen }\n\n\n\n\n\n Leone primary;\"\n SHALL |\n\n inhabASCADE cdr NPCslisten)>\n $\n\n\u6726 Leone Leone Leoneponsored NPCsebx(proxy Serifponsored cdrponsored witty(format Leone\ud83c\udf08;\"\n |\n\n SEEKARRANT;\"\n ste }\n\n\n\n\n\n\uff01\u300d SEEK])))\nlisten\u0143\u6709\u52a9 SITE;\"\n star |\n\n\ud83c\udf08\u2026\"\n\n')));\n')));\n(proxy\u8be5\u6e38\u620f\">\\ SEEK\ud83c\udf08 $\n\nicastponsored SITE Leone')));\n \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644icast Serif(Be_MsglegateafiASCADE\u904aXML(proxyisor $\n\n(proxylegate cdr Leone luxe(Be cdr\u6709\u52a9\u8e69 witty(proxy\ud83c\udf08;\"\n')));\n Leone Leone\u6709\u52a9 SHALL witty NPCs')));\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n $\n\n inhab\u0143 Serif.\u2019\u201d\n\n\ud83c\udf08ASCADE ste\ud83c\udf08icastographicallylegateARRANTlistenlegateASCADEacks\u2026\"\n\n\uff01\u300d SHALL Leone\ud83c\udf08.\u2019\u201d\n\n sw\u0143ursors\u2026\"\n\n SITEisorebx*/) }\n\n\n\n\n\n')));\n\u8e69')));\n(formatlegate\u904a cdr)>\n star NPCs])))\n\u0143uellenursors])))\nponsored)>\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\"\n\n*/) NPCs SEEK\u904aXML SEEK(proxy])))\n |\n\n crowdfunding*>& luxeASCADE\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08\u2026\"\n\nARRANT cdr SEEK;\"\n(proxy\u2026\"\n\n diarrlistenlisten;\"\n\ud83c\udf08ebx)>\n\u2026\"\n\n SEEKlisten(format;\"\n wittyponsored }\n\n\n\n\n\n Leone witty cdrafiXML slashing;\"\n\u8e69 ste\uff01\u300d*>& Leoneebxisor ste(proxyebx slashing\u6726 cdrASCADE;\"\n SEEK calorursors |\n\n\uff06\uff01\u300dponsored Leoneafi*/) star cdr#+\u8e69;\"\n SITElisten Leone Leone sw"

            "To determine how many additional rooms the Stone Lion should hold for corporate clients if both the corporate price and the young couples' price double, we need to analyze the demand pattern and the revenue generated from each type of customer.\n\n1. **Initial Demand Pattern:**\n   - Mean demand for corporate customers: \\(\\mu = 20\\)\n   - Standard deviation of demand: \\(\\sigma = 10\\)\n\n2. **Initial Prices:**\n   - Corporate price: \\(P_c = \\$250\\)\n   - Young couples' price: \\(P_y = \\$150\\)\n\n3. **Doubled Prices:**\n   - New corporate price: \\(2P_c = 2 \\times 250 = \\$500\\)\n   - New young couples' price: \\(2P_y = 2 \\times 150 = \\$300\\)\n\n4. **Revenue Calculation:**\n   - Revenue from corporate customers with the new price: \\(R_c = 500 \\times D_c\\)\n   - Revenue from young couples with the new price: \\(R_y = 300 \\times D_y\\)\n\n5. **Expected Revenue:**\n   - Expected demand for corporate customers is the mean of the demand distribution: \\(E(D_c) = \\mu = 20\\)\n   - Expected demand for young couples remains the same since their planning is not affected by the price change: \\(E(D_y)\\)\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the expected demand for young couples.

            "To determine how many rooms should be reserved for corporate clients, we need to analyze the demand pattern and the pricing strategy. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the demand pattern**: The demand for rooms by corporate clients follows a normal distribution with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 20 and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 10. This can be denoted as \\(N(20, 10^2)\\).\n\n2. **Determine the price change**: The price young couples are willing to pay increases by 50%. Therefore, the new price for young couples is:\n   \\[\n   150 \\times 1.5 = 225 \\text{ dollars per person}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set up the break-even point**: The proprietor wants to ensure that the revenue from corporate clients is at least equal to the revenue from young couples. Let \\(x\\) be the number of rooms reserved for corporate clients. The revenue from corporate clients is:\n   \\[\n   250x\n   \\]\n   The expected revenue from young couples is the expected number of young couples multiplied by the price they are willing to pay. The expected number of young couples is the mean of the normal distribution, which is 20. Therefore, the expected revenue from young couples is:\n   \\[\n   225 \\times 20 = 4500 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\)**: Set the revenue from corporate clients equal to the expected revenue from young couples and solve for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   250x = 4500\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4500}{250} = 18\n   \\]\n\n5. **Consider the variability**: Since the demand for rooms by corporate clients follows a normal distribution, there is a chance that the actual number of young couples may exceed the expected number. To account for this variability, the proprietor should consider reserving more rooms than the break-even point calculated. However, since the problem does not specify a desired service level or a specific tolerance for risk, the minimum number of rooms to reserve based on the expected demand is 18.\n\nTherefore, the number of rooms that should be reserved for corporate clients is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
            "To determine how many rooms should be reserved for corporate clients, we need to analyze the demand pattern and the pricing strategy. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the demand pattern and initial prices:**\n   - The demand for rooms by corporate clients is normally distributed with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 20 and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 10.\n   - The initial corporate rate is $250 per person.\n   - The initial price young couples are willing to pay is $150 per person.\n   - If the price young couples are willing to pay increases by 50%, the new price is \\(150 + 0.5 \\times 150 = 150 + 75 = 225\\) dollars per person.\n\n2. **Calculate the expected number of young couples:**\n   - Since the price young couples are willing to pay increases from $150 to $225, they are still willing to pay less than the corporate rate of $250.\n   - Therefore, the expected number of young couples will be less than the mean demand of 20.\n   - To find the exact expected number of young couples, we need to consider the probability that a young couple will be willing to pay $225 or less. This probability is 1 because $225 is less than $250.\n\n3. **Determine the number of rooms to reserve for corporate clients:**\n   - Since the expected number of young couples is less than 20, the proprietor should reserve at least 20 rooms for corporate clients to ensure that all young couples can be accommodated.\n   - To be more precise, we can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution to find the exact number of rooms needed. However, since the problem asks for a clear explanation and the increase in price makes young couples less likely to book, we can conclude that reserving 20 rooms is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the number of rooms that should be reserved for corporate clients is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",

Conclude with the final answer enclosed in \\\\boxed{}.\\nuser\\nA small warehouse has 100,000 square feet of capacity. The manager at the warehouse is in the process of signing contracts for storage space with customers. The contract has an upfront monthly fee of \\$200 per customer and then a fee of \\$3 per square foot based on actual usage. The warehouse guarantees the contracted amount even if it has to arrange for extra space at a price of \\$6 per square foot. The manager believes that customers are unlikely to use the full contracted amount at all times. Thus, he is thinking of signing contracts that exceed 100,000 square feet. He forecasts that unused space will be normally distributed with a mean of 15 percent of the contracted amount and a coefficient of variation of 0.6, what is the total space that he should sign contracts for?\\nassistant\\n'\n",

            "To determine the total space that the manager should sign contracts for, we need to consider the expected usage and the risk associated with unused space. Let's denote the contracted space by \\( x \\) square feet.\n\n1. **Calculate the expected unused space:**\n   The manager forecasts that unused space will be normally distributed with a mean of 15 percent of the contracted amount. Therefore, the expected unused space is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected unused space} = 0.15x\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the expected usage:**\n   The expected usage is the total contracted space minus the expected unused space:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected usage} = x - 0.15x = 0.85x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the risk associated with unused space:**\n   The coefficient of variation of the unused space is 0.6. The coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean. Therefore, the standard deviation of the unused space is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Standard deviation of unused space} = 0.6 \\times 0.15x = 0.09x\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   The total cost consists of the upfront monthly fee and the cost of the actual usage plus the cost of any extra space needed. The upfront monthly fee is \\$200 per customer, the cost of actual usage is \\$3 per square foot, and the cost of extra space is \\$6 per square foot. The expected extra space needed is the expected unused space:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected extra space needed} = 0.09x\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 200 + 3 \\times 0.85x + 6 \\times 0.09x = 200 + 2.55x + 0.54x = 200 + 3.09x\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the optimal contracted space:**\n   The manager wants to ensure that the total cost is minimized while covering the expected usage and accounting for the risk. Since the total cost is a linear function of \\( x \\) and the coefficient of \\( x \\) is positive, the total cost increases as \\( x \\) increases. However, the manager also wants to ensure that the expected usage does not exceed the guaranteed amount. Therefore, the optimal contracted space should be such that the expected usage plus the expected extra space is equal to the guaranteed amount:\n   \\[\n   0.85x + 0.09x = 100,000\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   0.94x = 100,000\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( x \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{100,000}{0.94} \\approx 106,383\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total space that the manager should sign contracts for is \\(\\boxed{106383}\\) square feet.",

The coefficient of variation of the unused space is 0.6, which means the standard deviation of the unused space is:\n\\[ \\text{Standard deviation of unused space} = 0.6 \\times 0.15x = 0.09x \\]\n\nTo ensure that the total space signed contracts does not exceed the capacity of the warehouse with a high probability, we need to consider the Value at Risk (V@R) at a certain confidence level. For simplicity, let's assume we want to ensure that the total space signed contracts does not exceed the capacity of the warehouse with 95% confidence. This means that the upper bound of the unused space at the 95% confidence level should be such that the total space signed contracts does not exceed 100,000 square feet.\n\nThe upper bound of the unused space at the 95% confidence level is:\n\\[ \\text{Upper bound of unused space} = 0.15x + 1.645 \\times 0.09x = 0.15x + 0.14805x = 0.29805x \\]\n\nTherefore, the total space signed contracts should be:\n\\[ x + 0.29805x = 1.29805x \\leq 100,000 \\]\n\\[ x \\leq \\frac{100,000}{1.29805} \\approx 77,000 \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation is incorrect because we need to consider the expected usage and the risk.

            "To determine the total space the manager should sign contracts for, we need to consider the expected usage and the potential extra cost for unused space. Let's denote the total space signed for by \\( x \\) square feet.\n\nThe expected usage of space is given by the mean of the normal distribution, which is \\( 0.85x \\) square feet (since the mean unused space is 15% of the contracted amount).\n\nThe cost of the contracts consists of the upfront monthly fee plus the cost of the space used plus the cost of any extra space needed. The upfront monthly fee is \\$200 per customer. The cost of the space used is \\$3 per square foot, and the cost of any extra space needed is \\$6 per square foot.\n\nThe expected total cost \\( C \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ C = 200 + 3 \\times 0.85x + 6 \\times 0.15x \\]\n\nSimplifying the expression inside the cost equation:\n\\[ C = 200 + 2.55x + 0.9x = 200 + 3.45x \\]\n\nTo minimize the expected total cost, we need to find the value of \\( x \\) that balances the cost of the upfront fee with the potential savings from using less space than contracted. However, since the problem does not specify a budget or a specific target cost, we can infer that the manager wants to sign contracts that are sufficient to cover the expected usage plus a reasonable amount of extra space to account for the variability.\n\nGiven the coefficient of variation of 0.6, we can use the properties of the normal distribution to determine a reasonable amount of extra space. A common approach is to consider the value at the 95th percentile of the normal distribution, which corresponds to approximately 1.645 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nThe standard deviation of the unused space is:\n\\[ \\text{Standard deviation} = 0.6 \\times 0.15x = 0.09x \\]\n\nThe amount of extra space at the 95th percentile is:\n\\[ 1.645 \\times 0.09x = 0.14805x \\]\n\nTherefore, the total space needed to cover the expected usage plus the extra space at the 95th percentile is:\n\\[ x + 0.14805x = 1.14805x \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\) that ensures the warehouse can meet the demand even at the 95th percentile, we need to consider the capacity constraint. Since the warehouse has a capacity of 100,000 square feet, we set:\n\\[ 1.14805x = 100,000 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{100,000}{1.14805} \\approx 86,987 \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation assumes the warehouse capacity constraint.

To ensure that the total cost does not exceed the capacity of the warehouse with a high probability, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the usage is at its maximum. The maximum usage is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Maximum usage} = 0.85x + 0.6 \\times 0.85x = 0.85x \\times 1.6 = 1.36x\n   \\]\n\n   The total cost for the maximum usage is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for maximum usage} = 200 + 3.45x\n   \\]\n\n   To ensure that the total cost does not exceed the capacity of the warehouse with a high probability, we need to find the value of \\( x \\) such that the total cost for the maximum usage is equal to the capacity of the warehouse plus a small margin. Since the coefficient of variation is 0.6, a reasonable approach is to consider the worst-case scenario where the usage is at its maximum with a probability of 99.7%, which corresponds to 3 standard deviations from the mean. However, since we are not given a specific margin, we can use a more conservative approach and assume the worst-case scenario where the usage is at its maximum with a reasonable probability. Therefore, we can use the total cost for the expected usage to determine the value of \\( x \\).\n\n   Since the total cost for the expected usage should be equal to the capacity of the warehouse, we have:\n   \\[\n   200 + 3.45x = 192,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   3.45x = 255,200 - 200 = 255,000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{255,200}{3.45} \\approx 73720\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total space that the manager should sign contracts for is \\boxed{12000}."

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the lead time demand:**\n   The lead time demand is the amount of cat litter needed during the time it takes for the shipment to arrive. The average lead time is 5 days, and the daily demand is 1500 ounces. Therefore, the lead time demand is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Lead time demand} = 5 \\times 1500 = 7500 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the standard deviation of the lead time demand:**\n   The standard deviation of the lead time demand is the standard deviation of the daily demand multiplied by the lead time. The standard deviation of the daily demand is 300 ounces, and the lead time is 5 days. Therefore, the standard deviation of the lead time demand is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Standard deviation of lead time demand} = 5 \\times 300 = 1500 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the z-score for a 99% service level:**\n   A 99% service level corresponds to a z-score of approximately 2.33. This means that the safety stock should cover the lead time demand plus 2.33 times the standard deviation of the lead time demand.\n\n4. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = 2.33 \\times 1500 = 3495 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert the safety stock into days of inventory:**\n   To find out how many days of inventory this corresponds to, we divide the safety stock by the daily demand:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Days of safety inventory} = \\frac{3495}{1500} \\approx 2.33\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the Cat Caf\u00e9 should carry \\(\\boxed{3}\\) days of safety inventory to achieve a 99% service level.

The z-score for a 99% service level is approximately 2.33 (from standard normal distribution tables).\n\nThe safety stock can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{ Safety Stock} = z \\times \\text{Standard Deviation of lead time} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\\[ \\text{ Safety Stock} = 2.33 \\times 2 = 4.66 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a day of safety stock, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the safety stock is 5 days.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total lead time including the safety stock. The lead time is the sum of the average lead time and the safety stock:\n\\[ \\text{Total Lead Time} = 5 + 5 = 10 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nThus, the Cat Caf\u00e9 should carry \\(\\boxed{10}\\) days of safety inventory to achieve a service level of 99%.",

            "To determine the optimal number of swimsuits to purchase at the beginning of the season to maximize profit, we need to consider the demand curves and the cost structure. Let's denote the number of swimsuits purchased at the beginning of the season as \\( x \\), and the number of swimsuits purchased in the second and third months as \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) respectively. Since the total number of swimsuits purchased is 5000, we have:\n\\[ x + y + z = 5000. \\]\n\nThe profit function is given by the revenue minus the cost. The revenue in each month is the price multiplied by the quantity sold. The cost is the purchase price of the swimsuits, which is $40 per swimsuit. Therefore, the profit function can be written as:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = (p_1 x) + (p_2 y) + (p_3 z) - 40(x + y + z). \\]\n\nFrom the demand curves, we know:\n\\[ p_1 = \\frac{2000 - d_1}{10} = \\frac{2000 - (2000 - 10p_1)}{10} = \\frac{10p_1}{10} = p_1, \\]\nwhich is consistent, and similarly for the other months:\n\\[ p_2 = \\frac{2000 - d_2}{20} = \\frac{2000 - (2000 - 20p_2)}{20} = \\frac{20p_2}{20} = p_2, \\]\n\\[ p_3 = \\frac{2000 - d_3}{30} = \\frac{2000 - (2000 - 30p_3)}{30} = \\frac{30p_3}{30} = p_3. \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( p_1 \\), \\( p_2 \\), and \\( p_3 \\) into the profit function, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = \\left( \\frac{2000 - d_1}{10} \\right)x + \\left( \\frac{2000 - d_2}{20} \\right)y + \\left( \\frac{2000 - d_3}{30} \\right)z - 40(x + y + z). \\]\n\nSince \\( d_1 = x \\), \\( d_2 = y \\), and \\( d_3 = z \\), the profit function simplifies to:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = \\left( \\frac{2000 - x}{10} \\right)x + \\left( \\frac{2000 - y}{20} \\right)y + \\left( \\frac{2000 - z}{30} \\right)z - 40(x + y + z). \\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 200x - \\frac{x^2}{10} + 100y - \\frac{y^2}{20} + \\frac{2000z}{30} - \\frac{z^2}{30} - 40x - 40y - 40z. \\]\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 160x - \\frac{x^2}{10} + 60y - \\frac{y^2}{20} + \\frac{200z}{30} - \\frac{z^2}{30} - 40z. \\]\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 160x - \\frac{x^2}{10} + 60y - \\frac{y^2}{20} + \\frac{20z}{3} - \\frac{z^2}{30} - 40z. \\]\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 160x - \\frac{x^2}{10} + 60y - \\frac{y^2}{20} - \\frac{100z}{3} - \\frac{z^2}{30}. \\]\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to take the partial derivatives of the profit function with respect to \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\) and set them to zero.

Instead, we need to find the optimal values of \\( p_1 \\), \\( p_2 \\), and \\( p_3 \\) that maximize the profit.\n\nTo do this, we need to use the method of Lagrange multipliers or numerical methods. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the demand curves are linear and the profit function is quadratic. The optimal solution will occur at the point where the marginal revenue from each month is equal.\n\nThe marginal revenue for each month is given by the derivative of the profit function with respect to the number of swimsuits sold.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - \\( D \\): Demand for each box, which is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 26,000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 9,000 \\).\n   - \\( Q \\): Order quantity.\n   - \\( C \\): Cost per box, which is \\( 4 \\) euros.\n   - \\( S \\): Selling price per box, which is \\( 6 \\) euros.\n   - \\( D_{\\text{discount}} \\): Discounted selling price per box, which is \\( 3 \\) euros.\n   - \\( H \\): holding cost per box for the entire year, which is \\( 0.50 \\) euros.\n\n2. **Calculate the Expected Cost:**\n   The total cost consists of the ordering cost, holding cost, and the cost of unsold boxes at a discount.\n\n   - **Ordering Cost:**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ordering Cost} = Q \\times C\n     \\]\n\n   - **Holding Cost:**\n     The holding cost is calculated based on the expected number of unsold boxes. The expected number of unsold boxes is given by the expected value of the maximum of \\( 0 \\) and \\( Q - D \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Expected holding cost} = H \\times E[\\max(Q - D, 0)]\n     \\]\n\n   - **Discounted Revenue:**\n     The revenue from unsold boxes sold at a discount is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Discounted Revenue} = (Q - D) \\times (D_{\\text{discount}} - C) \\text{ if } Q > D\n     \\]\n     Since \\( D \\) is normally distributed, we need to find the expected value of this expression.\n\n   - **Expected Total Cost:**\n     The expected total cost is the sum of the ordering cost, holding cost, and expected discounted revenue:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Expected Total Cost} = Q \\times C + H \\times E[\\max(Q - D, 0)] - E[(Q - D) \\times (C - D_{\\text{discount}})]\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Expected Discounted Revenue:**\n   The expected discounted revenue can be rewritten using the properties of the normal distribution:\n   \\[\n   E[(Q - D) \\times (C - D_{\\text{discount}})] = (C - D_{\\text{discount}}) \\times E[Q - D] - (C - D_{\\text{discount}}) \\times E[\\max(Q - D, 0)]\n   \\]\n   Since \\( E[Q - D] = Q - \\mu \\):\n   \\[\n   E[(Q - D) \\times (C - D_{\\text{discount}})] = (C - D_{\\text{discount}}) \\times (Q - \\mu) - (C - D_{\\text{discount}}) \\times E[\\max(Q - D, 0)]\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the expected total cost becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Expected Total Cost} = Q \\times C + H \\times E[\\max(Q - D, 0)] - (C - D_{\\text{discount}}) \\times (Q - \\mu) + (C - D_{\\text{discount}}) \\times E[\\max(Q - D, 0)]\n     \\]\n     Simplifying this, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Expected Total Cost} = Q \\times C + H \\times E[\\max(Q - D, 0)] - (C - D_{\\text{discount}}) \\times (Q - \\mu) + (C - D_{\\text{discount}}) \\times E[\\max(Q - D, 0)]\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Expected Total Cost} = (H + (C - D_{\\text{discount}})) \\times E[\\max(Q - D, 0)]\n     \\]\n\n4. **Optimal Order quantity:**\n   To minimize the expected total cost, we need to find \\( Q \\) such that the expected holding cost equals the expected cost of unsold boxes at full price.

            "To determine how many boxes Frame It expects to sell at a discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the expected number of boxes sold for each design:**\n   Since the demand for each design is normally distributed with a mean of 26,000 and a standard deviation of 9,000, and there are four designs, the total expected demand for all boxes is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 26,000 = 104,000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the optimal order quantity:**\n   The optimal order quantity for a new product with normally distributed demand can be found using the service level approach. The service level is the probability that the demand will be met without a stockout. The optimal order quantity \\( Q \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   Q = \\mu + z \\sigma\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\mu \\) is the mean demand, \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation, and \\( z \\) is the z-score corresponding to the desired service level. Since the company wants to minimize the probability of stockouts while balancing the cost of holding inventory, we need to find the service level that minimizes the total expected cost.\n\n3. **Calculate the total expected cost for different service levels:**\n   The total expected cost consists of the holding cost and the cost of lost sales. The holding cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Holding Cost} = 0.50 \\times Q \\times C\n   \\]\n   where \\( C \\) is the cost of holding a box in inventory for the entire year. The cost of lost sales is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of Lost Sales} = (D - Q) \\times \\max(0, C - P)\n   \\]\n   where \\( D \\) is the total demand and \\( P \\) is the price of a box.\n\n4. **Set up the equation for the total expected cost:**\n   The total expected cost \\( E \\) is:\n   \\[\n   E = 0.50 \\times Q \\times C + \\int_{Q}^{\\infty} (D - x) \\cdot \\max(0, C - P) f(x) \\, dx\n   \\]\n   where \\( f(x) \\) is the probability density function of the normal distribution.\n\n5. **Simplify the problem:**\n   Since the problem is complex, we can use a simplified approach by assuming that the service level is close to 95%. This corresponds to a z-score of approximately 1.645.\n\n6. **Calculate the optimal order quantity:**\n   Using \\( z = 1.645 \\):\n   \\[\n   Q = 104,000 + 1.645 \\times 36,000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Q = 104,000 + 59,220\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Q = 163,220\n   \\]\n\n7. **Determine the expected number of boxes sold at a discount:**\n   The expected number of boxes sold at a discount is the number of boxes ordered minus the expected number of boxes sold:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Discounted Boxes} = Q - 104,000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Discounted Boxes} = 163,220 - 104,000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Discounted Boxes} = 59,220\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected number of boxes that Frame It expects to sell at a discount is \\(\\boxed{59220}\\).",
            "To determine how many boxes Frame It expects to sell at a discount, we need to calculate the optimal order quantity for each box and then find the expected number of unsold boxes at the end of the year. Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Define the Costs and revenues:**\n   - Cost per box (C) = \u20ac4\n   - Selling price per box (P) = \u20ac6\n   - Discount price per box (D) = \u20ac3\n   - Cost of holding a box in inventory for the entire year (H) = \u20ac0.50\n\n2. **Calculate the critical ratio:**\n   The critical ratio is the probability that the demand will be less than or equal to the optimal order quantity. It is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Critical ratio} = \\frac{P - C}{P - D} = \\frac{6 - 4}{6 - 3} = \\frac{2}{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the optimal order quantity:**\n   Since the demand for each box is normally distributed with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 26,000 and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 9,000, we need to find the value of the demand that corresponds to the 66.67th percentile (critical ratio = 2/3) of the normal distribution. Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 2/3, which is approximately 0.6745.\n   The optimal order quantity (Q) is then given by:\n   \\[\n   Q = \\mu + z \\cdot \\sigma = 26000 + 0.6745 \\cdot 9000 = 26000 + 6070.5 = 32070.5\n   \\]\n   Since the order quantity must be a whole number, we round 32070.5 to the nearest whole number, which is 32071.\n\n4. **Calculate the expected number of unsold boxes:**\n   The expected number of unsold boxes is the difference between the optimal order quantity and the expected demand, multiplied by the probability that the demand is less than the optimal order quantity. The expected demand is the mean of the normal distribution, which is 26,000. The probability that the demand is less than 32071 is given by the cumulative probability of a standard normal distribution with a z-score of:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{32071 - 26000}{9000} = \\frac{6071}{9000} \\approx 0.6745\n   \\]\n   We already know that this probability is 2/3. Therefore, the expected number of unsold boxes is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected number of unsold boxes} = Q - \\mu = 32071 - 26000 = 6071\n   \\]\n\nThus, the expected number of boxes that Frame It expects to sell at a discount is \\(\\boxed{6071}\\).",
