            "To determine the cost of understocking that justifies the current inventory policy at DoorRed pharmacy, we need to calculate the total cost of holding inventory and the total cost of back logarith demand. The goal is to find the cost of back logarith demand that makes the total cost of the inventory policy equal to the total cost of holding inventory.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of holding inventory. The holding cost is 25% of the cost of the inventory. The cost of each bottle is \\$4, so the holding cost per bottle is:\n\\[ 0.25 \\times 4 = 1 \\text{ dollar per bottle} \\]\n\nThe average inventory level under the current policy can be calculated using the formula for the average inventory level in a base stock system with a lead time of 1 day. The average inventory level is the sum of the expected demand during the lead time and half of the order quantity minus the expected demand during the lead time if the inventory level is below the re order point when the order is placed.\n\nThe expected demand during the lead time is the mean of the demand distribution, which is 40 bottles. When the inventory level drops below 45 bottles, an order of 200 bottles is placed. The expected demand during the lead time if the inventory level is below 45 bottles is the same as the expected demand during the lead time, which is 40 bottles. Therefore, the average inventory level is:\n\\[ 40 + \\frac{200 - 40}{2} = 40 + 80 = 120 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nThe total cost of holding inventory is:\n\\[ 120 \\times 1 = 120 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of back logarith demand. The back logarith demand is the expected number of bottles short per cycle multiplied by the cost per bottle. The expected number of bottles short per cycle can be calculated using the formula for the expected number of bottles short in a base stock system with a lead time of 1 day. The expected number of bottles short per cycle is the difference between the order quantity and the expected demand during the lead time if the inventory level is below the re order point when the order is placed.\n\nThe expected number of bottles short per cycle is:\n\\[ 200 - 45 + 45 \\times \\left( \\frac{40 - 45}{5} \\right) \\times \\left( 1 - \\Phi \\left( \\frac{45 - 40}{5} \\right) \\right) \\]\nwhere \\(\\Phi\\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. The value of \\(\\frac{45 - 40}{5} = 1\\), and \\(\\Phi(1) \\approx 0.8413\\). Therefore, the expected number of bottles short per cycle is:\n\\[ 200 - 40 + 45 \\times (-1) \\times (1 - 0.8413) = 160 - 45 \\times 0.1587 = 160 - 7.1415 = 152.8585 \\]\n\nThe total cost of back logarith demand is:\n\\[ 152.8585 \\times 4 = 611.434 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTo find the cost of back logarith demand that justifies the current policy, we set the total cost of holding inventory equal to the total cost of back logarith demand and solve for the back logarith demand cost per bottle:\n\\[ 120 = 152.8585 \\times x \\]\nwhere \\(x\\) is the cost of back logarith demand per bottle. Solving for \\(x\\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{120}{152.8585} \\approx 0.786 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of understocking that justifies the current policy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.79} \\]",

We will then find the cost of understocking by subtracting the holding cost from the total cost of back logarith demand.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the holding cost per bottle per year. The holding cost is 25% of the cost of each bottle:\n\\[ \\text{Holding cost per bottle per year} = 0.25 \\times 4 = 1 \\text{ dollar} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the average inventory level under the current policy. The policy is to order 200 bottles when the quantity on hand drops below 45. Since the lead time is one day, the average inventory level is the average of the initial inventory level before an order is placed and the inventory level after the order is received. The initial inventory level before an order is placed is 45 bottles, and the inventory level after the order is received is 200 bottles. Therefore, the average inventory level is:\n\\[ \\text{Average inventory level} = \\frac{45 + 200 - 45}{2} = 125 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nThe total holding cost per year is the average inventory level multiplied by the holding cost per bottle per year:\n\\[ \\text{Total holding cost per year} = 125 \\times 1 = 125 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total back logarith cost per year. The back logarith cost is the cost of all unfilled demand over the year. To find the average back logarith quantity per day, we need to determine the probability that the inventory level drops below 45 bottles. This probability can be found using the standard normal distribution. The z-score corresponding to an inventory level of 45 bottles is:\n\\[ z = \\frac{45 - 40}{5} = 1 \\]\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table, the probability that the z-score is less than 1 is approximately 0.8413. This means that the probability that the inventory level drops below 45 bottles is 0.1587. Since the lead time is one day, the average back logarith quantity per day is:\n\\[ \\text{Average back logarith quantity per day} = 0.1587 \\times 5 = 0.7935 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nThe total back logarith quantity per year is the average back logarith quantity per day multiplied by the number of days in a year (365):\n\\[ \\text{Total back logarith quantity per year} = 0.7935 \\times 365 = 288.8775 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nThe total back logarith cost per year is the total back logarith quantity per year multiplied by the cost per bottle:\n\\[ \\text{Total back logarith cost per year} = 288.8775 \\times 4 = 1155.51 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, the cost of understocking is the total back logarith cost per year minus the total holding cost per year:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of understocking} = 1155.51 - 125 = 1030.51 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of understocking that justifies the current policy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1030.51} \\]",

            "To determine the optimal changeover cost for the mill to produce I-beams in batches of 40 tons every eight weeks, we need to calculate the total cost of production and holding the I-beams in inventory. The total cost includes both the production cost and the holding cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the annual production cost. The mill produces 40 tons per batch and has a production rate of 20 tons per week. Therefore, it takes 2 weeks to produce each batch (40 tons / 20 tons per week = 2 weeks). Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the mill will produce 52 / 2 = 26 batches per year. The cost to produce each batch is the setup cost plus the cost of the I-beams produced in that batch. Let's denote the setup cost by \\( S \\). The cost to produce each batch is \\( S + 40 \\times 2000 = S + 80000 \\) dollars. Therefore, the annual production cost is:\n\\[ 26 \\times (S + 80000) = 26S + 2080000. \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the annual holding cost. The mill produces 40 tons every eight weeks, so it starts with 40 tons at the beginning of the first eight weeks and ends with 0 tons at the end of the eighth week. The average inventory over the eight weeks is:\n\\[ \\frac{40 + 0}{2} = 20 \\text{ tons}. \\]\nThe holding cost per ton per year is 25% of the cost of the I-beams, which is:\n\\[ 0.25 \\times 2000 = 500 \\text{ dollars per ton per year}. \\]\nTherefore, the annual holding cost is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 500 = 10000 \\text{ dollars}. \\]\n\nThe total annual cost is the sum of the annual production cost and the annual holding cost:\n\\[ 26S + 2080000 + 10000 = 26S + 2090000. \\]\n\nTo find the optimal changeover cost, we need to minimize this total cost. The setup cost \\( S \\) is the only variable in the equation. The total cost is a linear function of \\( S \\), and it increases as \\( S \\) increases. Therefore, the minimum total cost occurs when \\( S \\) is as small as possible. However, the problem does not specify a minimum value for \\( S \\) other than it being a positive value. The problem is asking for the changeover cost that makes the batch size of 40 tons optimal.\n\nTo find the changeover cost that makes the batch size of 40 tons optimal, we need to compare the total cost for different batch sizes. Let's consider a batch size of \\( Q \\) tons. The mill will produce \\( \\frac{52}{\\frac{Q}{20}} = \\frac{1040}{Q} \\) batches per year. The annual production cost is:\n\\[ \\frac{1040}{Q} \\times (S + Q \\times 2000) = \\frac{1040S}{Q} + 2080000. \\]\nThe average inventory over the \\( \\frac{Q}{20} \\) weeks is:\n\\[ \\frac{Q + 0}{2} = \\frac{Q}{2} \\text{ tons}. \\]\nThe annual holding cost is:\n\\[ \\frac{Q}{2} \\times 500 = 250Q \\text{ dollars}. \\]\nThe total annual cost is:\n\\[ \\frac{1040S}{Q} + 2080000 + 250Q. \\]\n\nTo find the optimal batch size, we take the derivative of the total cost with respect to \\( Q \\) and set it to zero:\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dQ} \\left( \\frac{1040S}{Q} + 2080000 + 250Q \\right) = -\\frac{1040S}{Q^2} + 250 = 0. \\]\nSolving for \\( Q \\), we get:\n\\[ 250Q^2 = 1040S, \\]\n\\[ Q^2 = \\frac{1040S}{250} = \\frac{104S}{25}, \\]\n\\[ Q = \\sqrt{\\frac{104S}{25}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{26S}}{",
            "To determine the optimal changeover cost for the mill to produce I-beams in batches of 40 tons every eight weeks, we need to calculate the total cost of production, which includes the setup cost and the holding cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the annual holding cost for the I-beams. The mill produces 40 tons per batch and each batch lasts eight weeks. Therefore, the mill produces \\(40 \\text{ tons/batch} \\times \\frac{52 \\text{ weeks}}{8 \\text{ weeks/batch}} = 260 \\text{ tons/year}\\).\n\nThe holding cost is 25% of the total cost of the I-beams.

Therefore, the number of batches produced per year is \\(\\frac{260 \\text{ tons/year}}{40 \\text{ tons/batch}} = 6.5 \\text{ batches/year}\\).

We want to find the value of \\(C\\) that minimizes this total cost. The total annual cost is given by:\n\\[\n\\$130,000 + 6.5C\n\\]\n\nTo find the optimal changeover cost, we need to compare this total cost to the total cost for other batch sizes. However, since the problem specifies that the mill wants to produce I-beams in batches of 40 tons every eight weeks, we only need to consider this batch size.\n\nTherefore, the optimal changeover cost is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20000}\n\\]",

We need to find the changeover cost that makes the total annual cost of production with batches of 40 tons equal to or less than the total annual cost of production with smaller batches.\n\nLet's assume the mill produces I-beams in smaller batches of 1 ton per week.

Using a standard normal distribution table, we find that the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.9091 is approximately 1.33.\n\nNow, we can calculate the optimal order quantity \\( Q^* \\) using the formula for the optimal order quantity in a new product situation:\n\\[\nQ^* = \\mu + z^* \\sigma = 100 + 1.33 \\times 50 = 100 + 66.5 = 166.5\n\\]\n\nSince the order quantity must be a whole number, we round 166.5 to the nearest whole number, which is 167.\n\nTherefore, the optimal cycle service level is the probability that the demand will be less than or equal to 167 units.

The manufacturer has a production capacity of 1,000 units per day, and currently, all production capacity gets booked about one week in advance. This means that the manufacturer has already sold some units to customers who are willing to pay \\$10 per unit.\n\nSince the demand for the high-price segment is normally distributed, we need to find the probability that the demand will exceed the remaining production capacity on the last day. Let's denote the remaining production capacity on the last day as \\( x \\).

However, since the manufacturer has a total production capacity of 1,000 units per day and has already sold some units to customers who are willing to pay \\$10 per unit, the remaining production capacity on the last day will be less than 1,000 units.\n\nGiven that the manufacturer has already sold some units to customers who are willing to pay \\$10 per unit, the remaining production capacity on the last day will be the total production capacity minus the units already sold. Since the problem does not specify how many units have already been sold, we can assume that the remaining production capacity is the same as the total production capacity minus some units.

The formula for EOQ is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{EOQ} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times D \\times S}{H}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(D\\) is the annual demand, \\(S\\) is the cost per order, and \\(H\\) is the holding cost per half cup per year.\n   Here, \\(D = 23764\\), \\(S = 3\\), and \\(H = 0.02\\). Plugging in these values, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{EOQ} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 23764 \\times 3}{0.02}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{142584}{0.02}} = \\sqrt{7129200} = 2670 \\text{ half cups}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of orders placed in a year:**\n   The number of orders placed in a year is the annual demand divided by the EOQ:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of orders} = \\frac{23764}{2670} \\approx 8.88\n   \\]\n   Since the number of orders must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number, which is 9 orders.\n\n4. **Determine the average inventory level:**\n   The average inventory level is half of the EOQ:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average inventory} = \\frac{2670}{2} = 1335 \\text{ half cups}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the average flow time:**\n   The average flow time is the average inventory level divided by the annual demand rate (in half cups per day). First, we find the daily demand rate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily demand} = \\frac{23764}{365} \\approx 65 \\text{ half cups per day}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the average flow time is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average flow time} = \\frac{1335}{65} \\approx 20.54 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n   Since the average flow time is asked in whole days, we round to the nearest whole number, which is 21 days.\n\nThus, the average flow time of a half cup of peas is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",

            "To determine the cost of overstocking, we need to calculate the expected cost of holding inventory and the expected cost of lost sales. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - Mean demand, \\(\\mu = 100\\)\n   - Standard deviation of demand, \\(\\sigma = 50\\)\n   - Cost to manufacture each unit, \\(C = \\$75\\)\n   - Introductory price of each unit, \\(P = \\$125\\)\n   - Cost to hold each unit in inventory, \\(H = \\$10\\)\n   - Cost toisors each unsold unit, \\(S = \\$25\\)\n\n2. **Calculate the Cost of Overstocking:**\n   The cost of overstocking is the expected cost of holding inventory and the expected cost of lost sales. Let \\(Q\\) be the number of units produced. The expected cost of overstocking can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Cost of Overstocking} = H \\cdot E[\\max(Q - D, 0)] - S \\cdot E[\\max(D - Q, 0)]\n   \\]\n   where \\(D\\) is the demand.\n\n3. **Expected Cost of holding Inventory:**\n   The expected cost of holding inventory is the cost of holding the expected number of unsold units. The expected number of unsold units is \\(Q - E[D]\\) if \\(Q > E[D]\\) and 0 otherwise. However, we need to use the properties of the normal distribution to find the expected value of the unsold units.\n   \\[\n   E[\\max(Q - D, 0)] = Q - \\mu + \\sigma \\phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu - Q}{\\sigma}\\right)\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\phi(x)\\) is the standard normal density function.\n\n4. **Expected Cost of Lost Sales:**\n   The expected cost of lost sales is the cost of the expected number of units not sold. The expected number of units not sold is \\(E[D] - Q\\) if \\(E[D] > Q\\) and 0 otherwise. Again, we use the properties of the normal distribution to find the expected value of the unsold units.\n   \\[\n   E[\\max(D - Q, 0)] = \\mu - Q + \\sigma \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substitute the Values:**\n   Let's substitute the given values into the formulas. We will assume \\(Q = 150\\) to find the cost of overstocking.\n   \\[\n   E[\\max(150 - D, 0)] = 150 - 100 + 50 \\phi\\left(\\frac{100 - 150}{50}\\right) = 50 + 50 \\phi(-1) = 50 + 50 \\cdot 0.3466 = 50 + 17.33 = 67.33\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E[\\max(D - 150, 0)] = 100 - 150 + 50 \\phi\\left(\\frac{150 - 100}{50}\\right) = -50 + 50 \\phi(1) = -50 + 50 \\cdot 0.3466 = -50 + 17.33 = -32.67\n   \\]\n   The expected cost of overstocking is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Cost of Overstocking} = 10 \\cdot 67.33 - 25 \\cdot (-32.67) = 673.3 + 816.75 = 1490.05\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the cost of overstocking is \\(\\boxed{1490}\\).",

This can be done using the critical ratio formula for the normal distribution:\n   \\[\n   F(Q) = \\frac{\\text{Profit per unit sold}}{\\text{Profit per unit sold} + \\text{Loss per unit unsold}} = \\frac{50}{50 + 50} = 0.5\n   \\]\n   Since \\(F(Q) = 0.5\\), \\(Q\\) is equal to the mean of the demand distribution:\n   \\[\n   Q = \\mu = 100\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the expected number of units sold:**\n   Since the demand is normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu = 100\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 50\\), the expected number of units sold is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected number of units sold} = \\mu = 100\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the expected number of units unsold:**\n   Since the optimal number of units to order is 100 and the expected number of units sold is also 100:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected number of units unsold} = Q - \\text{Expected number of units sold} = 100 - 100 = 0\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the expected cost of holding inventory:**\n   Since the expected number of units unsold is 0, the expected cost of holding inventory is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected cost of holding inventory} = 0\n   \\]\n\n8. **Calculate the expected cost of lost sales:**\n   Since the expected number of units sold is 100, the expected cost of lost sales is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected cost of lost sales} = 0\n   \\]\n\n9. **Calculate the cost of overstocking:**\n   Since the expected number of units unsold is 0, the cost of overstocking is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of overstocking} = \\boxed{0}\n   \\]\n\nHowever, if we need to consider overstocking by more than 100 units, we can use the expected cost of holding inventory and the expected cost of lost sales to calculate the cost of overstocking. Let's assume overstocking by \\(x\\) units, where \\(x > 0\\).\n\nThe expected number of units unsold would be \\(x\\). The expected cost of holding inventory would be:\n\\[\n\\text{Expected cost of holding inventory} = x \\times H = x \\times 10\n\\]\n\nThe expected number of units sold would be 100. The expected cost of lost sales would be:\n\\[\n\\text{Expected cost of lost sales} = 0\n\\]\n\nThe total expected cost of overstocking would be:\n\\[\n\\text{Total expected cost of overstocking} = \\text{Expected cost of holding inventory} = x \\times 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of overstocking per unit is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",

            "To determine the cost of understocking, we need to calculate the expected cost of not meeting the demand. We start by defining the variables and the profit function.\n\nLet \\( Q \\) be the number of units produced. The profit function \\( P(Q, D) \\) depends on the demand \\( D \\):\n- If \\( D \\leq Q \\), the profit is \\( P(Q, D) = (125 - 75)D - 10Q + 25(Q - D) = 50D + 15Q - 10Q - 25D = 25D + 5Q \\).\n- If \\( D > Q \\), the profit is \\( P(Q, D) = (125 - 75)Q - 10Q = 50Q - 10Q = 40Q \\).\n\nThe expected profit \\( E[P(Q)] \\) is the weighted average of these profits, where the weights are the probabilities of different demands. Since the demand \\( D \\) is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 100 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 50 \\), we can use the standard normal distribution \\( Z = \\frac{D - 100}{50} \\).\n\nThe expected profit is:\n\\[ E[P(Q)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} (25D + 5Q) f(D) \\, dD + \\int_{Q}^{\\infty} 40Q f(D) \\, dD, \\]\nwhere \\( f(D) \\) is the probability density function of the normal distribution.\n\nWe can rewrite the integrals in terms of the standard normal distribution:\n\\[ E[P(Q)] = 5Q \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} f(D) \\, dD + \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} 25D f(D) \\, dD + 40Q \\int_{Q}^{\\infty} f(D) \\, dD - \\int_{Q}^{\\infty} 40D f(D) \\, dD. \\]\nThe first and third terms are the expected value of \\( Q \\) times the probability of demand being less than or equal to \\( Q \\) and the expected value of \\( Q \\) times the probability of demand being greater than \\( Q \\), respectively. The second and fourth terms are the expected value of \\( D \\) times the probability of demand being less than or equal to \\( Q \\) and the expected value of \\( D \\) times the probability of demand being greater than \\( Q \\), respectively.\n\nUsing the properties of the normal distribution, we know:\n\\[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} f(D) \\, dD = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 100}{50}\\right), \\]\n\\[ \\int_{Q}^{\\infty} f(D) \\, dD = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 100}{50}\\right), \\]\n\\[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} D f(D) \\, dD = 100 \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 100}{50}\\right) + 50^2 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 100}{50}\\right), \\]\n\\[ \\int_{Q}^{\\infty} D f(D) \\, dD = 100 (1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 100}{50}\\right)) - 50^2 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 100}{50}\\right), \\]\nwhere \\( \\Phi(z) \\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution and \\( \\phi(z) \\) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution.\n\nSubstituting these into the expected profit equation, we get:\n\\[ E[P(Q)] = 5Q \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 100}{50}\\right) + 100 \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 100}{50}\\right) + 2500 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 100}{50}\\right) + 40Q (1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 100}{50}\\right)) - 40Q - 20000 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 100}{50}\\right). \\]\nSimplifying, we have:\n\\[ E[P(Q)] = 5Q \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 100}{50}\\",
            "To determine the cost of understocking, we need to calculate the expected profit for different production quantities and then find the production quantity that maximizes the expected profit.

The demand \\( D \\) is normally distributed with a mean \\( \\mu = 100 \\) and a standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 50 \\).\n\nThe revenue from selling the units is given by the number of units sold multiplied by the price per unit. If the demand \\( D \\) is less than or equal to \\( Q \\), then the revenue is \\( D \\times 125 \\). If the demand \\( D \\) is greater than \\( Q \\), then the revenue is \\( Q \\times 125 \\).

            "To determine the cost of understocking, we need to calculate the expected profit for different levels of initial inventory and find the level that maximizes this profit. The profit function can be expressed as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = (\\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost of manufacturing}) - (\\text{Cost of holding inventory} + \\text{Cost of unsold units})\n\\]\n\nLet's denote the initial inventory level by \\( Q \\). The revenue is the number of units sold multiplied by the selling price, which is \\( 125 \\times \\min(Q, D) \\), where \\( D \\) is the demand. The cost of manufacturing is \\( 75Q \\). The cost of holding inventory is \\( 10Q \\), and the cost of unsold units is \\( 25 \\times (\\max(0, Q - D)) \\).\n\nThe expected profit can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected Profit} = 125 \\times E[\\min(Q, D)] - 75Q - 10Q - 25 \\times E[\\max(0, Q - D)]\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected Profit} = 125 \\times E[\\min(Q, D)] - 85Q - 25 \\times E[\\max(0, Q - D)]\n\\]\n\nWe know that \\( D \\) is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 100 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 50 \\). The expected value of \\( \\min(Q, D) \\) and \\( \\max(0, Q - D) \\) can be calculated using the properties of the normal distribution.

For \\( Q = 100 + k\\sigma \\), we have \\( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} = k \\), so:\n\n\\[\nE[\\min(Q, D)] = 100 + 50 \\phi(k) - (100 + 50k) \\Phi(k)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nE[\\max(0, Q - D)] = 50 (1 - \\Phi(k))\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into the expected profit formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected Profit} = 125 \\left(100 + 50 \\phi(k) - (100 + 50k) \\Phi(k)\\right) - 85 (100 + 50k) - 25 \\times 50 (1 - \\Phi(k))\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected Profit} = 12500 + 6250 \\phi(k) - 12500 \\Phi(k) - 8500 - 4250k - 1250 + 1250 \\Phi(k)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected Profit} = 2750 + 6250 \\phi(k) - 11250 \\Phi(k) - 4250k\n\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( k \\) that maximizes the expected profit, we take the derivative with respect to \\( k \\) and set it to zero:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dk} \\text{Expected Profit} = 6250 \\phi(k) - 11250 \\phi(k) - 4250 = -5000 \\phi(k) - 4250\n\\]\n\nSetting the derivative to zero, we get:\n\n\\[\n-5000 \\phi(k) - 4250 = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\phi(k) = -0.85\n\\]\n\nHowever, since \\( \\phi(k) \\) is always between -1 and 1, this equation has no real solution. This indicates that we need to check the boundary values of \\( k \\) to find the maximum expected profit. Given the problem constraints, we can test values around \\( k = 1.64 \\) (which corresponds to a service level of 95%).\n\nBy testing \\( k = 2 \\), we find that the expected profit is maximized.

            "To determine the cost of understocking, we need to calculate the expected cost of not meeting the demand. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define the variables:**\n   - Mean demand, \\(\\mu = 100\\)\n   - Standard deviation of demand, \\(\\sigma = 50\\)\n   - Cost to manufacture each unit, \\(C_m = 75\\)\n   - Introductory price per unit, \\(P = 125\\)\n   - Disposition value per unsold unit, \\(P_d = 25\\)\n   - Cost to hold each unit in inventory, \\(C_h = 10\\)\n\n2. **Calculate the profit per unit if sold:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit per unit} = P - C_m = 125 - 75 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the loss per unit if not sold:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Loss per unit} = C_m - P_d = 75 - 25 = 50\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the critical ratio:**\n   The critical ratio is the probability that the demand will be less than or equal to the optimal number of units to stock. It is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Critical ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Profit per unit}}{\\text{Profit per unit} + \\text{Loss per unit}} = \\frac{50}{50 + 50} = 0.5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find the corresponding z-score for the critical ratio:**\n   Since the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 50, we need to find the z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.5. The z-score for a cumulative probability of 0.5 is 0.\n\n6. **Calculate the optimal number of units to stock:**\n   Using the z-score, we can find the optimal number of units to stock using the formula for the inverse of the normal distribution:\n   \\[\n   Q^* = \\mu + z \\cdot \\sigma = 100 + 0 \\cdot 50 = 100\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the expected demand:**\n   The expected demand is the mean of the normal distribution, which is 100 units.\n\n8. **Calculate the probability of understocking:**\n   Since the optimal number of units to stock is equal to the expected demand, the probability of understocking is 0.\n\n9. **Calculate the cost of understocking:**\n   Since the probability of understocking is 0, the cost of understocking is also 0.\n\nHowever, there seems to be an assumption that the optimal number of units to stock was calculated incorrectly based on actual sales data in real-world scenarios.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - Mean demand (\\(\\mu\\)): 100 units\n   - Standard deviation of demand (\\(\\sigma\\)): 50 units\n   - Cost to manufacture each unit: \\$75\n   -Introductory price per unit: \\$125\n   - Disposition value per unsold unit: \\$25\n   - Cost to hold each unit in inventory: \\$10\n\n2. **Calculate the Profit per Unit Sold and the Loss per Unit Unsold:**\n   - Profit per unit sold: \\$125 - \\$75 = \\$50\n   - Loss per unit unsold: \\$75 - \\$25 - \\$10 = \\$40\n\n3. **Determine the Optimal stocking\u91cf:**\n   The optimal stocking\u91cf is the quantity that minimizes the expected total cost. This can be found using the critical fractile formula for the newsvendor problem:\n   \\[\n   F^* = \\frac{\\text{Profit per unit sold}}{\\text{Profit per unit sold} + \\text{Loss per unit unsold}} = \\frac{50}{50 + 40} = \\frac{50}{90} = \\frac{5}{9}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(F^*\\) is the cumulative probability of the demand being less than or equal to the optimal stocking\u91cf.\n\n4. **Find the Optimal Stocking\u91cf:**\n   We need to find the value of \\(Q\\) such that \\(P(X \\leq Q) = \\frac{5}{9}\\), where \\(X\\) is normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu = 100\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 50\\). Using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\):\n   \\[\n   z = \\Phi^{-1}\\left(\\frac{5}{9}\\right) \\approx 0.5244\n   \\]\n   The optimal stocking\u91cf \\(Q\\) is then given by:\n   \\[\n   Q = \\mu + z\\sigma = 100 + 0.5244 \\times 50 = 100 + 26.22 = 126.22\n   \\]\n   Since we can only stock whole units, we round \\(Q\\) to the nearest whole number. Therefore, \\(Q = 126\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Expected Cost of Understocking:**\n   The expected cost of understocking is the expected value of the cost of not meeting the demand when the stocking\u91cf is 126. This can be calculated as follows:\n   - The expected demand is 100 units.\n   - The probability that the demand is greater than 126 is \\(P(X > 126) = 1 - P(X \\leq 126)\\).\n   - Using the z-score for 126:\n     \\[\n     z = \\frac{126 - 100}{50} = 0.52\n     \\]\n     From the standard normal distribution table, \\(P(X \\leq 126) \\approx 0.6985\\). Therefore, \\(P(X > 126) = 1 - 0.6985 = 0.3015\\).\n   - The expected number of units unsold is \\(126 - 100 = 26\\) units.\n   - The expected number of units unsold when the demand is greater than 126 is \\(100 - 126 = -26\\) units.\n\n   The expected cost of understocking is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected cost of understocking} = P(X > 126) \\times (\\text{Number of units unsold}) \\times \\text{Loss per unit unsold} = 0.3015 \\times 26 \\times 40 = 0.3015 \\times 1040 = 313.56\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of understocking is \\(\\boxed{313.56}\\).",
            "To determine the cost of understocking, we need to calculate the expected profit for different levels of initial inventory and then find the inventory level that maximizes the expected profit. Let's denote the initial inventory by \\( Q \\).\n\nThe profit for each unit sold is \\( \\$125 - \\$75 = \\$50 \\). The profit for each unsold unit is \\( \\$25 - \\$75 - \\$10 = -\\$60 \\) (a loss of \\$65 per unsold unit due to the manufacturing cost and holding cost).\n\nThe profit function can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 50 \\times \\text{number of units sold} - 65 \\times \\text{number of units unsold} \\]\n\nThe number of units sold is \\( \\min(Q, D) \\), where \\( D \\) is the demand.

            "To determine the optimal cycle service level for the lawn care equipment, we need to calculate the critical ratio, which is a key component in the newsvendor model.

In other words, the optimal cycle service level is 90%.\n\nTo verify, we can use the standard normal distribution. The demand is normally distributed with a mean \\( \\mu = 100 \\) and a standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 30 \\). We need to find the value of \\( z \\) such that \\( P(Z \\leq z) = 0.9 \\).

            "To evaluate the cost of stocking out implied by the current replenishment policy, we need to determine the probability that the store will run out of detergent before the lead time expges and then calculate the expected cost of this stocking out.\n\nFirst, let's find the total demand over the lead time. Since the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 100 gallons and a standard deviation of 20 gallons, the total demand over 2 weeks is also normally distributed with a mean of:\n\\[ D_{2 weeks} = 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\text{ gallons} \\]\nand a standard deviation of:\n\\[ \\sigma_{2 weeks} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 20 = 20\\sqrt{2} \\approx 28.28 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nThe store manager orders 400 gallons when the available inventory drops to 300 gallons. Therefore, the store will run out of detergent if the total demand over the lead time exceeds 100 gallons (since the initial inventory before the order is 300 gallons and the order is 400 gallons, so the total available inventory is 700 gallons, and 700 - 300 = 400 gallons).\n\nWe need to find the probability that the total demand over the lead time is greater than 400 gallons. We standardize the value 400 using the mean and standard deviation of the total demand over the lead time:\n\\[ Z = \\frac{400 - 200}{28.28} \\approx \\frac{200}{28.28} \\approx 7.07 \\]\n\nThe probability that a standard normal variable is greater than 7.07 is extremely small. Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find:\n\\[ P(Z > 7.07) \\approx 0 \\]\n\nThis means the probability that the store will run out of detergent before the lead time expges is essentially 0. Therefore, the expected cost of stocking out is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected cost of stocking out} = 0 \\times \\text{cost per gallon} \\times \\text{probability of stocking out} = 0 \\]\n\nHowever, if we assume there was a small probability of running out (which might be a more practical approach for actual decision making), we can use a very small value for the probability. But since the problem specificates a lead time and order quantity that is highly unlikely to stock out, we can conclude with certainty that the expected cost is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]",

The weekly demand \\( D \\) is normally distributed with a mean \\( \\mu_D = 100 \\) gallons and a standard deviation \\( \\sigma_D = 20 \\) gallons.

Therefore, the store will run out of detergent if the total demand during the lead time exceeds 100 gallons (since \\( 400 - 300 = 100 \\)).\n   We need to find \\( P(D_{\\text{ lead time}} > 100) \\).

The stockout cost is the cost of the additional detergent needed to meet the demand that exceeds 100 gallons.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Determine the lead time demand:**\n   The lead time is 2 weeks, and the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 100 gallons and a standard deviation of 20 gallons.

Therefore, the safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = 400 - 300 = 100 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the probability of stocking out:**\n   The safety stock of 100 gallons corresponds to a z-score for the lead time demand.

Since the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 100 gallons and a standard deviation of 20 gallons, the total demand over 2 weeks ( lead time) is also normally distributed with a mean of \\(2 \\times 100 = 200\\) gallons and a standard deviation of \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times 20 = 20\\sqrt{2} \\approx 28.28\\) gallons.\n\nThe store manager orders 400 gallons when the available inventory drops to 300 gallons. Therefore, the store will run out of detergent if the total demand over the lead time exceeds 100 gallons (400 - 300).\n\nWe need to find the probability that the total demand over the lead time is greater than 100 gallons. This probability can be calculated using the standard normal distribution. The z-score for 100 gallons is:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{100 - 200}{28.28} = \\frac{-100}{28.28} \\approx -3.54\n\\]\nThe probability that the total demand over the lead time is greater than 100 gallons is the same as the probability that a standard normal random variable is greater than -3.54. This probability is:\n\\[\nP(Z > -3.54) = 1 - P(Z < -3.54)\n\\]\nUsing a standard normal table or a calculator, we find that \\(P(Z < -3.54) \\approx 0.0002\\). Therefore:\n\\[\nP(Z > -3.54) \\approx 1 - 0.0002 = 0.9998\n\\]\nThis means that the probability of running out of detergent is approximately 0.9998.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the expected cost of stocking out. The expected cost of stocking out is the probability of running out of detergent multiplied by the cost of stocking out per gallon. Since all unfilled demand is backlog and carried over to the next cycle, the expected cost of stocking out is the probability of running out of detergent multiplied by the cost of the detergent that is backlog.\n\nThe expected amount of detergent backlog per cycle is the difference between the demand and the initial inventory plus the order quantity, which is:\n\\[\n\\text{Expected backlog} = 200 - 300 + 400 = 300 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\nThe cost of each gallon of detergent is \\$3, so the expected cost of stocking out per cycle is:\n\\[\n\\text{Expected cost of stocking out} = 0.0002 \\times 300 \\times 3 = 1.8\n\\]\nTherefore, the cost of stocking out implied by the current replenishment policy is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.8}\n\\]"

Since the total number of parkas sold is \\( 900 - p_1 - 1.3p_2 - 1.8p_3 \\), the retailer should purchase \\( Q = 900 \\) parkas.\n\nThus, the optimal number of parkas the retailer should purchase at the beginning of the season to maximize profits is:\n\\[ \\boxed{900} \\]",
            "To determine the optimal number of parkas the retailer should purchase at the beginning of the season to maximize profits, we need to consider the profit function for each month and then sum these profits over the three months. The profit for each month is given by the revenue minus the cost.\n\nLet's denote the number of parkas purchased at the beginning of the season by \\( Q \\). The retailer will sell the parkas at different prices each month, \\( p_1 \\), \\( p_2 \\), and \\( p_3 \\), and the demand in each month is given by \\( d_1 = 300 - p_1 \\), \\( d_2 = 300 - 1.3p_2 \\), and \\( d_3 = 300 - 1.8p_3 \\). The profit for each month can be expressed as follows:\n\n1. Profit for the first month: \\( (p_1 - 100)d_1 = (p_1 - 100)(300 - p_1) = 300p_1 - p_1^2 - 30000 + 100p_1 = -p_1^2 + 400p_1 - 30000 \\).\n2. Profit for the second month: \\( (p_2 - 100)d_2 = (p_2 - 100)(300 - 1.3p_2) = 300p_2 - 1.3p_2^2 - 30000 + 130p_2 = -1.3p_2^2 + 430p_2 - 30000 \\).\n3. Profit for the third month: \\( (p_3 - 100)d_3 = (p_3 - 100)(300 - 1.8p_3) = 300p_3 - 1.8p_3^2 - 30000 + 180p_3 = -1.8p_3^2 + 480p_3 - 30000 \\).\n\nThe total profit over the three months is the sum of the profits for each month:\n\\[ \\text{Total Profit} = (-p_1^2 + 400p_1 - 30000) + (-1.3p_2^2 + 430p_2 - 30000) + (-1.8p_3^2 + 480p_3 - 30000) = -p_1^2 - 1.3p_2^2 - 1.8p_3^2 + 400p_1 + 430p_2 + 480p_3 - 90000. \\]\n\nTo maximize the total profit, we need to find the values of \\( p_1 \\), \\( p_2 \\), and \\( p_3 \\) that maximize this expression. The profit functions for each month are quadratic functions that open downwards (since the coefficients of \\( p_1^2 \\), \\( p_2^2 \\), and \\( p_3^2 \\) are negative), so the maximum profit for each month occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex of a parabola given by \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) is at \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n\nFor the first month:\n\\[ p_1 = -\\frac{400}{2(-1)} = 200. \\]\nFor the second month:\n\\[ p_2 = -\\frac{430}{2(-1.3)} = \\frac{430}{2.6} \\approx 165.38. \\]\nFor the third month:\n\\[ p_3 = -\\frac{480}{2(-1.8)} = \\frac{480}{3.6} \\approx 133.33. \\]\n\nSince the retailer cannot sell a fraction of a parka, we will consider the integer values closest to these prices. We will check the profits for \\( p_1 = 200 \\), \\( p_2 = 165 \\), and \\( p_3 = 133 \\).\n\nFor \\( p_1 = 200 \\):\n\\[ d_1 = 300 - 200 = 100. \\]\nFor \\( p_2 = 165 \\):\n\\[ d_2 = 300 - 1"

The total inventory cost consists of the holding cost and the cost of placing orders. The holding cost is:\n\\[\n\\text{Holding cost} = \\frac{\\text{EOQ}}{2} \\times H = \\frac{1888}{2} \\times 0.02 = 944 \\times 0.02 = 18.88 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThe cost of placing orders is:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of placing orders} = \\frac{D}{\\text{EOQ}} \\times C = \\frac{11882}{1888} \\times 3 \\approx 6.25 \\times 3 = 18.75 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nAdding the holding cost and the cost of placing orders gives the total inventory cost:\n\\[\n\\text{Total inventory cost} = 18.88 + 18.75 = 37.63 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the inventory policy is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{37.63}\n\\]"

Let's denote the number of units manufactured by \\( Q \\).\n\nThe profit can be broken down into the revenue from selling the units, the cost of manufacturing the units, and the cost of holding the unsold units in inventory. The profit function \\( P(Q) \\) can be expressed as follows:\n\n\\[ P(Q) = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost of manufacturing} - \\text{Cost of holding unsold units} + \\text{Revenue from selling unsold units} \\]\n\nThe revenue from selling \\( Q \\) units is:\n\\[ \\text{Revenue} = 150Q \\]\n\nThe cost of manufacturing \\( Q \\) units is:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of manufacturing} = 75Q \\]\n\nThe cost of holding the unsold units in inventory is:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of holding unsold units} = 10 \\times \\text{number of unsold units} = 10(Q - D) \\]\nwhere \\( D \\) is the demand, which is a random variable with a normal distribution \\( N(100, 30^2) \\).\n\nThe revenue from selling unsold units is:\n\\[ \\text{Revenue from selling unsold units} = 60 \\times \\text{number of unsold units} = 60(Q - D) \\]\n\nCombining these, the profit function becomes:\n\\[ P(Q) = 150Q - 75Q - 10(Q - D) + 60(Q - D) = 75Q - 10Q + 10D - 60Q + 60D = 5Q + 70D - 50Q = 10D - 5Q \\]\n\nSince \\( D \\) is a random variable, we need to find the expected value of the profit function. The expected value of the profit function \\( E[P(Q)] \\) is:\n\\[ E[P(Q)] = E[10D - 5Q] = 10E[D] - 5Q = 10 \\times 100 - 5Q = 1000 - 5Q \\]\n\nTo maximize the expected profit, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that maximizes \\( 1000 - 5Q \\). However, this expression is linear and decreases as \\( Q \\) increases, so there is no maximum value within the range of possible values for \\( Q \\). Instead, we need to consider the expected profit function in the context of the inventory cost and the probability of different demand scenarios.\n\nTo find the optimal production quantity, we use the critical fractile method. The critical fractile is given by:\n\\[ F(Q) = \\frac{150 - 75 - 10}{150 - 60} = \\frac{65}{90} = \\frac{13}{18} \\approx 0.7222 \\]\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( Q \\) such that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution \\( N(100, 30^2) \\) is equal to 0.7222. Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find the z-score corresponding to a CDF of 0.7222, which is approximately 0.58.\n\nThe z-score is given by:\n\\[ z = \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{Q - 100}{30} \\]\n\nSetting this equal to 0.58, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{Q - 100}{30} = 0.58 \\]\n\\[ Q - 100 = 0.58 \\times 30 \\]\n\\[ Q - 100 = 17.4 \\]\n\\[ Q = 117.4 \\]\n\nSince \\( Q \\) must be an integer, we round 117.4 to the nearest whole number, which is 117.
