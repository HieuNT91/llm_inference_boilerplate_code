The demand is normally distributed with a mean \\(\\mu = 350\\) and a standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 100\\). We want to find the probability that the demand \\(X\\) is greater than 450. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ P(X > 450) \\]\n\nTo standardize this, we convert the value 450 to a z-score using the formula:\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ z = \\frac{450 - 350}{100} = 1 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that a standard normal random variable \\(Z\\) is greater than 1. This is given by:\n\\[ P(Z > 1) = 1 - P(Z \\leq 1) \\]\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that:\n\\[ P(Z \\leq 1) \\approx 0.8413 \\]\nTherefore:\n\\[ P(Z > 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 \\]\n\nThis means that the probability that the demand for skis exceeds 450 is 0.1587. The expected understock is the expected value of the excess demand, which is the demand minus the number of pairs ordered, multiplied by the probability of excess demand:\n\\[ \\text{Expected understock} = (450 - 350) \\times P(X > 450) = 100 \\times 0.1587 = 15.87 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the expected understock is:\n\\[ \\boxed{15.87} \\]",
            "To evaluate the expected understock as a result of the manager ordering 450 pairs of skis, we need to determine the probability that the demand for skis will exceed 450 pairs and then use this probability to find the expected understock.\n\nFirst, we standardize the demand using the z-score formula:\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\nwhere \\( X \\) is the demand, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation. Here, \\( X = 450 \\), \\( \\mu = 350 \\), and \\( \\sigma = 100 \\). Plugging in these values, we get:\n\\[ z = \\frac{450 - 350}{100} = 1 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that the z-score is greater than 1. This is equivalent to finding \\( P(Z > 1) \\), where \\( Z \\) is a standard normal random variable. Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find:\n\\[ P(Z > 1) = 1 - P(Z \\leq 1) \\]\nFrom the standard normal distribution table, \\( P(Z \\leq 1) \\approx 0.8413 \\). Therefore:\n\\[ P(Z > 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 \\]\n\nThe probability that the demand will exceed 450 pairs of skis is 0.1587. The expected understock is the expected value of the excess demand, which is the probability of understocking multiplied by the expected excess demand. The expected excess demand is the difference between the demand and the order quantity when the demand exceeds the order quantity. Since the demand is normally distributed, the expected excess demand when the demand exceeds 450 pairs is:\n\\[ E(\\text{excess demand} \\mid \\text{demand} > 450) = \\mu + \\sigma \\cdot \\phi(z) - 450 \\]\nwhere \\( \\phi(z) \\) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution at \\( z = 1 \\). From the standard normal distribution table, \\( \\phi(1) \\approx 0.3989 \\). Therefore:\n\\[ E(\\text{excess demand} \\mid \\text{demand} > 450) = 350 + 100 \\cdot 0.3989 - 450 = 350 + 39.89 - 450 = 39.89 \\]\n\nThe expected understock is then:\n\\[ \\text{Expected understock} = P(\\text{demand} > 450) \\cdot E(\\text{excess demand} \\mid \\text{demand} > 450) = 0.1587 \\cdot 39.89 \\approx 6.34 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the expected understock is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]",

Since the store sells 650 jackets each month, the average number of jackets in inventory can be calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average inventory} = \\frac{550 \\text{ jackets} - (650 \\text{ jackets} \\times \\frac{1}{12})}{2}\n   \\]\n   First, calculate the monthly sales in units of jackets:\n   \\[\n   650 \\text{ jackets} \\times \\frac{1}{12} = 54.17 \\text{ jackets}\n   \\]\n   Now, calculate the average inventory:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average inventory} = \\frac{550 - 54.17}{2} = \\frac{495.83}{2} = 247.92 \\text{ jackets}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the annual holding cost:**\n   The annual holding cost is 30 percent of the total value of the average inventory. The value of the average inventory is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value of average inventory} = 247.92 \\text{ jackets} \\times 80 \\text{ euros/jacket} = 19833.6 \\text{ euros}\n   \\]\n   The annual holding cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual holding cost} = 19833.6 \\text{ euros} \\times 0.30 = 5950.08 \\text{ euros}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the annual holding cost is \\(\\boxed{5950.08}\\).",

Therefore, the average number of jackets in inventory can be calculated as follows:\n   - At the beginning of the first month, the store has 550 jackets.\n   - At the end of each month, the store has 550 - 650 = -100 jackets, but since the store cannot have a negative number of jackets in inventory, we consider the average over the month.\n   - The average number of jackets in inventory is the average of the number of jackets at the beginning and at the end of the month:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average inventory per month} = \\frac{550 + 0}{2} = 275\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the average number of jackets in inventory over the year is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average inventory per year} = 275 \\times 12 = 3300\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the annual holding cost:**\n   The holding cost per jacket is 30% of the cost of each jacket. The cost of each jacket is \u20ac80, so the holding cost per jacket is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Holding cost per jacket} = 0.30 \\times 80 = 24\n   \\]\n   The annual holding cost is then:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual holding cost} = \\text{Average inventory per year} \\times \\text{Holding cost per jacket} = 3300 \\times 24 = 79200\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the annual holding cost is \\(\\boxed{79200}\\).",
