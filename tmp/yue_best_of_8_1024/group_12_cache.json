Since there are two weeks left and each week has 168 hours, the lead time is 24 hours, which is less than one week. Therefore, segment A will receive the shipment within the lead time.\n\n3. **Calculate the expected demand for segment A:**\n   Since segment A will receive the shipment within the lead time, the expected demand for segment A is equal to the mean of the normal distribution, which is 3,000 cubic feet.\n\n4. **Reserve the capacity for segment A:**\n   The capacity reserved for segment A should be equal to the expected demand, which is 3,000 cubic feet.\n\nTherefore, the amount of capacity that should be reserved for segment A is \\(\\boxed{3000}\\).",

            "To determine how much of the available capacity should be reserved for segment A, we need to calculate the expected demand for segment A and then round it to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, we need to find the service level that corresponds to the probability of meet the demand within 24 hours.\n\n   Given that there are two weeks left, segment A will have a higher probability of canceling their shipment if the demand exceeds the reserved capacity. We need to find a service level that is appropriate for a short notice period.\n\n4. **Assume a service level:**\n   A common service level for short notice periods is around 90% (or 95%). Let's assume a service level of 95%.\n\n5. **Convert the service level to a z-score:**\n   Using the standard normal distribution table, a service level of 95% corresponds to a z-score of approximately 1.645.\n\n6. **Calculate the corresponding demand:**\n   Using the z-score formula:\n   \\[\n   X = \\mu + z \\cdot \\sigma\n   \\]\n   where \\(X\\) is the demand at the service level.\n   \\[\n   X = 3000 + 1.645 \\cdot 1000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   X = 3000 + 1645\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   X = 4645\n   \\]\n\n7. ** Round the result to the nearest whole number:**\n   Since we cannot reserve a fraction of a cubic foot, we round 4645 to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, the amount of capacity that should be reserved for segment A is \\(\\boxed{4645}\\).",

For simplicity, we will use the 95% confidence interval. The z-score for 95% confidence interval is approximately 1.645. This means that there is a 95% probability that the demand will be less than or equal to \\(\\mu + 1.645\\sigma\\).\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\\[\n\\mu + 1.645\\sigma = 3000 + 1.645 \\times 1000 = 3000 + 1645 = 4645\n\\]\nSo, with 95% confidence, the demand for segment A will be 4645 cubic feet or less.

Therefore, the holding cost per hour is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ holding cost per hour} = 0.80 \\text{ dollars/slice} \\times \\text{number of slices per hour} = 0.80 \\text{ dollars/loaf} \\times \\frac{\\text{ batch size}}{2}\n   \\]\n   Combining these, the total cost per hour is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{total cost per hour} = \\left( \\text{cost per loaf} \\times \\text{number of loaves} + 3 \\text{ dollars/loaf} \\right) \\times \\frac{\\text{ batch size}}{\\text{ production rate}} + \\text{ holding cost per hour}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{total cost per hour} = \\left( 1 \\text{ dollar/loaf} \\times \\text{ batch size} + 3 \\text{ dollars/loaf} \\right) \\times \\frac{\\text{ batch size}}{7 \\text{ loaves/hour}} + 0.80 \\text{ dollars/loaf} \\times \\frac{\\text{ batch size}}{2}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the expression, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{total cost per hour} = \\frac{\\text{ batch size}^2}{7} + \\frac{3 \\text{ batch size}}{7} + 0.4 \\text{ batch size}\n   \\]\n   Combining the terms involving \\(\\text{ batch size}\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{total cost per hour} = \\frac{\\text{ batch size}^2}{7} + \\frac{3 \\text{ batch size}}{7} + \\frac{2.8 \\text{ batch size}}{7} = \\frac{\\text{ batch size}^2 + 5.8 \\text{ batch size}}{7}\n   \\]\n   To minimize the total cost per hour, we take the derivative of the cost function with respect to \\(\\text{ batch size}\\) and set it to zero:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{d(\\text{ batch size})} \\left( \\frac{\\text{ batch size}^2 + 5.8 \\text{ batch size}}{7} \\right) = \\frac{2 \\text{ batch size} + 5.8}{7} = 0\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(\\text{ batch size}\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ batch size} + 5.8 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2 \\text{ batch size} = -5.8 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{ batch size} = -2.9\n   \\]\n   Since a negative batch size is not practical, we need to check the second derivative to ensure we have a minimum. The second derivative is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2}{d(\\text"

We also need to account for the fact that some customers are willing to pay an additional \u20ac6 if trims are available on the last day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability that the demand for trims on the last day will be greater than the production capacity reserved for the last day. We want to find the production capacity \\( Q \\) such that the probability of demand exceeding \\( Q \\) is equal to the probability that customers who are willing to pay the high price will not find trims available on the last day.\n\nSince the company sells production capacity for \u20ac12.00 per unit and customers who are willing to pay an additional \u20ac6 will pay \u20ac18.00 per unit, the company will lose \u20ac6 per unit if trims are not available on the last day to these customers. Therefore, the company should reserve enough capacity to ensure that the probability of demand exceeding the reserved capacity is equal to the probability that customers who are willing to pay the high price will not find trims available on the last day.\n\nThe probability that demand exceeds \\( Q \\) can be calculated using the standard normal distribution. Let \\( Z \\) be the standard normal variable. Then, we have:\n\\[ P(D > Q) = P\\left(Z > \\frac{Q - 375}{100}\\right) \\]\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( Q \\) such that:\n\\[ P\\left(Z > \\frac{Q - 375}{100}\\right) = 0.5 \\]\n\nThis means that \\( \\frac{Q - 375}{100} \\) should be equal to 0 (since the median of the standard normal distribution is 0):\n\\[ \\frac{Q - 375}{100} = 0 \\]\n\\[ Q = 375 \\]\n\nHowever, since some customers are willing to pay an additional \u20ac6 if trims are available on the last day, the company should reserve some additional capacity to ensure that the probability of demand exceeding the reserved capacity is equal to the probability that customers who are willing to pay the high price will not find trims available on the last day.\n\nTo determine the additional capacity needed, we need to consider the probability that demand will exceed the production capacity of 1,500 units. Since the company has production capacity of 1,500 units per day, we need to find the probability that demand exceeds 1,500 units:\n\\[ P(D > 1500) = P\\left(Z > \\frac{1500 - 375}{100}\\right) = P(Z > 11.25) \\]\n\nSince the standard normal distribution is symmetric and the probability of a standard normal variable being greater than a value greater than 4 standard deviations away from the mean is very small (approximately 0.00001), we can conclude that the company should reserve some capacity to ensure that the probability of demand exceeding the reserved capacity is equal to the probability that customers who are willing to pay the high price will not find trims available on the last day.\n\nGiven that some customers are willing to pay an additional \u20ac6 if trims are available on the last day, we can assume that the company should reserve some additional capacity to ensure that the probability of demand exceeding the reserved capacity is equal to the probability that customers who are willing to pay the high price will not find trims available on the last day.\n\nTherefore, the company should reserve some additional capacity to ensure that the probability of demand exceeding the reserved capacity is equal to the probability that customers who are willing to pay the high price will not find trims available on the last day. Given the problem constraints, we can assume that the company should reserve some capacity to ensure that the probability of demand exceeding the reserved capacity is equal to the probability that customers who are willing to pay the high price will not find trims available on the last day.\n\nTherefore, the company should reserve \\(\\boxed{1500}\\) production capacity for the last day.",

We want to find the production capacity that will meet the demand 90% of the time, since some customers are willing to pay an additional \u20ac6 if Kitchen Trims has capacity available on the last day.\n\nFirst, we need to find the 90th percentile of the normal distribution. The z-score corresponding to the 90th percentile can be found using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator. The z-score for the 90th percentile is approximately 1.28.\n\nNext, we use the z-score to find the corresponding demand value. The formula to convert a z-score to a value in the normal distribution is:\n\n\\[ X = \\mu + z \\cdot \\sigma \\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) is the demand value, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, \\( z \\) is the z-score, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.

            "To determine how many rooms should be reserved for corporate clients, we need to analyze the demand pattern and the costs involved. The demand for rooms by corporate clients follows a normal distribution with a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 10. The proprietor charges \\$250 per person for corporate clients, and the young couples pay \\$150 per person.\n\nLet's denote the number of rooms reserved for corporate clients as \\( x \\). The expected revenue from these rooms can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Expected Revenue from Corporate Clients:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Revenue}_{\\text{corporate}} = x \\times 250\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expected Revenue from Young Couples:**\n   The demand for rooms by young couples is also normally distributed with a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 10. If \\( x \\) rooms are reserved for corporate clients, the remaining rooms available for young couples is \\( 40 - x \\) (since the total number of rooms is 40).\n\n   The expected number of young couples who will stay at the property is the mean of the remaining demand, which is \\( 40 - x \\).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Revenue}_{\\text{young couples}} = (40 - x) \\times 150\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Expected Revenue:**\n   The total expected revenue is the sum of the expected revenues from corporate clients and young couples.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Expected Revenue} = x \\times 250 + (40 - x) \\times 150\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Total Expected Revenue:**\n   Simplify the expression to find the total expected revenue in terms of \\( x \\).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Expected Revenue} = 250x + 6000 - 150x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Expected Revenue} = 100x + 6000\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the Optimal Number of Rooms:**\n   To maximize the total expected revenue, we need to find the value of \\( x \\) that satisfies the demand pattern and ensures that the revenue is maximized. Since the demand for corporate clients is normally distributed with a mean of 20, we should consider reserving enough rooms to meet this mean demand.\n\n   If the proprietor reserves 20 rooms for corporate clients, the remaining rooms will be \\( 40 - 20 = 20 \\) rooms for young couples. This ensures that the demand for young couples is also satisfied, given that the standard deviation is 10, which means there is a high probability that the demand will not exceed 20 rooms on average.\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of rooms to reserve for corporate clients is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
            "To determine how many rooms should be reserved for corporate clients, we need to consider the demand pattern for corporate clients and the profit implications of different commission rates.\n\n1. **Define the random variable:**\n   Let \\( X \\) be the number of corporate clients. \\( X \\) follows a normal distribution with a mean \\( \\mu = 20 \\) and a standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 10 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the expected profit for each scenario:**\n   - ** correlation rate:**\n     - Revenue per corporate client: \\( \\$250 \\)\n     - Cost per corporate client: \\( \\$150 \\)\n     - Profit per corporate client: \\( \\$250 - \\$150 = \\$100 \\)\n     - Expected number of corporate clients: \\( E(X) = 20 \\)\n     - Expected profit for corporate clients: \\( 20 \\times 100 = \\$2000 \\)\n\n   - ** straight rate:**\n     - Revenue per corporate client: \\( \\$250 \\)\n     - Cost per corporate client: \\( \\$250 \\)\n     - Profit per corporate client: \\( \\$250 - \\$250 = \\$0 \\)\n     - Expected number of corporate clients: \\( E(X) = 20 \\)\n     - Expected profit for corporate clients: \\( 20 \\times 0 = \\$0 \\)\n\n3. **Consider the inventory constraint:**\n   The proprietor can only reserve a certain number of rooms for corporate clients. Let \\( n \\) be the number of rooms reserved for corporate clients.\n\n4. **Calculate the expected profit if \\( n \\) rooms are reserved:**\n   - ** correlation rate:**\n     - Probability that \\( X \\leq n \\): \\( P(X \\leq n) \\)\n     - Expected number of corporate clients: \\( E(X \\cap n) = n \\cdot P(X \\leq n) + (20 - n) \\cdot 0 = n \\cdot P(X \\leq n) \\)\n     - Expected profit for corporate clients: \\( 100 \\cdot n \\cdot P(X \\leq n) \\)\n\n   - ** straight rate:**\n     - Probability that \\( X \\leq n \\): \\( P(X \\leq n) \\)\n     - Expected number of corporate clients: \\( E(X \\cap n) = n \\cdot P(X \\leq n) \\)\n     - Expected profit for corporate clients: \\( 0 \\cdot n \\cdot P(X \\leq n) = 0 \\)\n\n5. **Maximize the expected profit:**\n   To maximize the expected profit, we need to find the value of \\( n \\) that maximizes \\( 100 \\cdot n \\cdot P(X \\leq n) \\).\n\n6. **Use the standard normal distribution:**\n   Convert \\( X \\) to the standard normal variable \\( Z \\) using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{X - 20}{10}\n   \\]\n   We need to find \\( n \\) such that \\( P(X \\leq n) = P\\left(Z \\leq \\frac{n - 20}{10}\\right) \\).\n\n7. **Determine the critical value:**\n   We need to find \\( n \\) such that \\( P\\left(Z \\leq \\frac{n - 20}{10}\\right) \\) is maximized while ensuring that the expected profit is positive. Since \\( P(X \\leq n) \\) is always increasing with \\( n \\), we should choose \\( n \\) such that the expected profit is positive and as large as possible.\n\n   By trial and error or using statistical software, we find that:\n   - For \\( n = 20 \\), \\( P(X \\leq 20) \\approx 0.5 \\)\n   - Expected profit: \\( 20 \\times 100 \\times 0.5 = \\$1000 \\)\n\n   - For \\( n = 15 \\), \\( P(X \\leq 15) \\approx 0.3085 \\)\n   - Expected profit: \\( 15 \\times 100 \\times 0.3085 = \\$462.75 \\)\n\n   - For \\( n = 25 \\), \\( P(X \\leq 25) \\approx 0.8413 \\)\n   - Expected profit: \\( 25 \\times 100 \\times 0.8413 = \\$2103.25 \\)\n\n   The expected profit is maximized when \\( n = 25 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of rooms that should be reserved",

            "To determine how many rooms should be reserved for corporate clients, we need to consider the demand pattern for corporate clients and the potential revenue lost due to overbooking or underbooking. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the demand pattern**: The demand for corporate clients is normally distributed with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 20 and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 10. This can be written as \\(N(20, 10^2)\\).\n\n2. **Define the variables**: Let \\(X\\) be the number of corporate clients who want to stay. The cost per corporate client is \\$250, and the revenue from each corporate client is also \\$250. If the proprietor reserves \\(Q\\) rooms for corporate clients, the expected number of corporate clients who will actually stay is \\(E(X \\mid X \\leq Q) = \\mu + \\sigma \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is the standard normal density function. The expected revenue from reserving \\(Q\\) rooms is \\(250 \\cdot E(X \\mid X \\leq Q)\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the expected number of corporate clients who will stay**: The expected number of corporate clients who will stay if \\(Q\\) rooms are reserved is \\(20 + 10 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 20}{10}\\right)\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the expected revenue**: The expected revenue from reserving \\(Q\\) rooms is \\(250 \\cdot (20 + 10 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 20}{10}\\right)) = 5000 + 2500 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 20}{10}\\right)\\).\n\n5. **Determine the optimal number of rooms to reserve**: The optimal number of rooms to reserve is the value of \\(Q\\) that maximizes the expected revenue. Since the revenue function \\(5000 + 2500 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 20}{10}\\right)\\) is increasing in \\(Q\\) until the point where the probability of aCorporate client finding a room is zero, we need to find the value of \\(Q\\) such that the probability of a Corporate client finding a room is zero. This means that \\(Q\\) should be set such that the probability of \\(X > Q\\) is zero, which is not possible since \\(X\\) is a continuous random variable. However, we can find the value of \\(Q\\) that minimizes the expected cost of overbooking and underbooking.\n\n6. **Calculate the expected cost of overbooking and underbooking**: The expected cost of overbooking is the expected number of empty rooms multiplied by the cost of an empty room, and the expected cost of underbooking is the expected number of no-shows multiplied by the cost of a no-show. The expected number of empty rooms is \\(Q - E(X \\mid X \\leq Q)\\), and the expected number of no-shows is \\(E(X \\mid X > Q)\\).\n\n7. **Set up the equation**: The expected cost of overbooking and underbooking is \\((Q - 20 - 10 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 20}{10}\\right)) \\cdot 250 + (E(X \\mid X > Q)) \\cdot 150\\). We need to find the value of \\(Q\\) that minimizes this cost. By symmetry and properties of the normal distribution, the optimal value of \\(Q\\) is the mean of the distribution, which is 20. However, since the proprietor is charging only \\$150 for corporate clients, we need to consider the potential revenue lost due to overbooking and underbooking.\n\n8. **Calculate the expected revenue for different values of \\(Q\\)**: By calculating the expected revenue for different values of \\(Q\\) and finding the value that maximizes the expected revenue, we find that the optimal number of rooms to reserve is 25.\n\nTherefore, the number of rooms that should be reserved for corporate clients is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",

The expected number of cakes sold is:\n\\[ E(\\text{number of cakes sold}) = \\min(Q, E(D)) = \\min(Q, 8000) \\]\n\\[ E(\\text{number of cakes sold at discount}) = \\max(Q - D, 0) \\]\n\\[ E(\\text{number of unsold cakes}) = \\max(Q - D, 0) \\]\n\nThe expected profit can be simplified to:\n\\[ E(P) = 26.50 \\cdot \\min(Q, 8000) + 2.50 \\cdot \\max(Q - 8000, 0) - 2.50 \\cdot \\max(Q - 8000, 0) = 26.50 \\cdot \\min(Q, 8000) \\]\n\nHowever, this is not accurate because we need to consider the probability of different demand scenarios. The correct approach is to use the service level concept. The service level \\( S \\) is the probability that the confectioner will meet the demand. We want to find the service level that corresponds to the optimal order quantity.\n\nThe service level \\( S \\) is given by:\n\\[ S = \\frac{26.50}{26.50 + 2.50} = \\frac{26.50}{29} = 0.9138 \\]\n\nThe service level corresponds to the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. We need to find the z-score corresponding to a CDF of 0.9138. Using a standard normal table or calculator, we find that:\n\\[ z = 1.38 \\]\n\nThe optimal order quantity \\( Q \\) is given by:\n\\[ Q = E(D) + z \\cdot \\sigma = 8000 + 1.38 \\cdot 2000 = 8000 + 2760 = 10760 \\]\n\nTherefore, M&S should order \\(\\boxed{10760}\\) cakes.",

            "To determine how many orders the supplier should accept, we need to balance the potential profit from selling dresses with the potential loss from cancellations. Let's define the following variables:\n\n- \\( x \\): number of orders accepted by the supplier.\n- \\( D \\): actual number of dresses sold, which follows a normal distribution with mean \\( \\mu = 800 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 400 \\).\n\nThe profit from selling \\( D \\) dresses is \\( 10D \\). The loss from cancellations is \\( 10(x - D) \\) if \\( D < x \\), and 0 if \\( D \\geq x \\). Therefore, the total profit \\( P \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[\nP = 10D - 5(x - D) = 15D - 5x \\quad \\text{if} \\quad D < x\n\\]\n\\[\nP = 10D - 0 = 10D \\quad \\text{if} \\quad D \\geq x\n\\]\nThe expected profit \\( E(P) \\) is the weighted average of these two scenarios, taking into account the probabilities of each scenario occurring. The probability that \\( D < x \\) is \\( P(D < x) \\), and the probability that \\( D \\geq x \\) is \\( P(D \\geq x) = 1 - P(D < x) \\). Therefore, the expected profit is:\n\\[\nE(P) = 15D - 5x \\cdot P(D < x) + 10D \\cdot (1 - P(D < x)) = 15D - 5x \\cdot P(D < x) + 10D - 10D \\cdot P(D < x) = 25D - 15x \\cdot P(D < x)\n\\]\nSince \\( D \\) is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 800 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 400 \\), we can standardize \\( D \\) to a standard normal variable \\( Z \\) using the formula \\( Z = \\frac{D - 800}{400} \\). The probability \\( P(D < x) \\) can then be rewritten as \\( P\\left(Z < \\frac{x - 800}{400}\\right) \\). Let \\( z = \\frac{x - 800}{400} \\). Then \\( P(D < x) = P(Z < z) \\), and the expected profit becomes:\n\\[\nE(P) = 25 \\cdot 800 - 15x \\cdot P(Z < z) = 20000 - 15x \\cdot P(Z < z)\n\\]\nTo maximize the expected profit, we need to find the value of \\( x \\) that maximizes this expression. This means we need to find the value of \\( z \\) that maximizes \\( 20000 - 15x \\cdot P(Z < z) \\). Since \\( x = 400z + 800 \\), we can substitute \\( x \\) into the expression for \\( E(P) \\):\n\\[\nE(P) = 20000 - 15(400z + 800) \\cdot P(Z < z) = 20000 - 6000z \\cdot P(Z < z) - 12000 \\cdot P(Z < z) = 8000 - 6000z \\cdot P(Z < z)\n\\]\nTo find the value of \\( z \\) that maximizes \\( E(P) \\), we need to take the derivative of \\( E(P) \\) with respect to \\( z \\) and set it to zero:\n\\[\n\\frac{dE(P)}{dz} = -6000P(Z < z) - 6000z \\cdot p(z) = -6000(P(Z < z) + z \\cdot p(z))\n\\]\nSetting the derivative equal to zero, we get:\n\\[\n-6000(P(Z < z) + z \\cdot p(z)) = 0 \\implies P(Z < z) + z \\cdot p(z) = 0 \\implies P(Z < z) = -z \\cdot p(z)\n\\]\nThe standard normal density function \\( p(z) \\) is given by \\( p(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{z^2}{2}} \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\\[\nP(Z < z) = -z \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e",

According to the problem, \\( X \\) follows a normal distribution with a mean \\( \\mu = 80 \\) and a standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 20 \\).\n\n2. **Determine the profit per box:**\n   The profit per box is the selling price minus the cost price:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit per box} = \\$290 - \\$125 = \\$165\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the expected profit if all boxes are sold:**\n   If the professor could sell all 50 boxes, the expected profit would be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit if all boxes are sold} = 50 \\times \\$165 = \\$8250\n   \\]\n   However, since the demand is a random variable, we need to consider the possibility that the professor may not be able to sell all 50 boxes.\n\n4. **Calculate the expected number of boxes sold:**\n   Since \\( X \\) is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 80 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 20 \\), and the professor has a suitcase capacity of 50 boxes, we need to find the probability that \\( X \\) is less than or equal to 50.

If the demand is less than or equal to the quantity ordered, the Jerk Store will sell all the packets ordered. If the demand is greater than the quantity ordered, the Jerk Store will sell only the quantity ordered.\n\nThe optimal quantity \\( Q \\) is the one that balances the cost of over-ordering (not selling all the packets) and the cost of under-ordering (not being able to meet the demand). This balance is found by setting the expected profit equal to the expected profit when the demand is equal to the quantity ordered.\n\nThe expected profit when the demand is equal to the quantity ordered is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected Profit when } D = Q = p \\cdot Q - c \\cdot Q = (8.75 - 2.50) \\cdot Q = 6.25Q. \\]\n\nWe set this equal to the expected profit when the demand is less than or equal to the quantity ordered:\n\\[ 15625 - 1.50Q = 6.25Q. \\]\n\nSolving for \\( Q \\):\n\\[ 15625 = 7.75Q, \\]\n\\[ Q = \\frac{15625}{7.75} \\approx 2000. \\]\n\nTherefore, the optimal quantity for the Jerk Store to order is \\(\\boxed{2500}\\). However, since the demand is normally distributed with a standard deviation of 600, we need to consider the service level and the corresponding z-score. The service level is the probability that the demand will be less than or equal to the quantity ordered. If we assume a service level of 95%, the z-score is 1.645. The optimal quantity is then:\n\\[ Q = \\mathbb{E}[D] + z \\cdot \\sigma = 2500 + 1.645 \\cdot 600 = 2500 + 987 = 3487. \\]\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{3500}\\)."

            "To determine how many donkeys the cruise line should have in its herd, we need to calculate the expected cost of the donkey service and compare it to the cost of purchasing donkey capacity on the spot market.\n\nFirst, let's define the random variable \\( X \\) as the number of tourists. \\( X \\) is normally distributed with a mean \\( \\mu = 10,000 \\) and a standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 3,000 \\). The cost of the donkey service is \\$15,000 per thousand tourists, so the cost per tourist is \\( \\frac{15,000}{1,000} = 15 \\) dollars.\n\nThe expected cost of the donkey service is given by the expected value of the cost function. If the cruise line has \\( n \\) donkeys, the number of tourists that will need donkey service is \\( \\max(X - n, 0) \\). Therefore, the expected cost of the donkey service is:\n\\[ E[15 \\max(X - n, 0)] = 15 E[\\max(X - n, 0)]. \\]\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( n \\) that minimizes the total expected cost, which includes the cost of the donkey herd and the expected cost of purchasing donkey capacity on the spot market. The total expected cost is:\n\\[ 15n + 15 E[\\max(X - n, 0)]. \\]\n\nTo find \\( E[\\max(X - n, 0)] \\), we use the properties of the normal distribution. Let \\( Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\), which is a standard normal random variable. Then:\n\\[ E[\\max(X - n, 0)] = E[\\max(\\sigma Z + \\mu - n, 0)] = \\sigma E[\\max(Z + \\frac{\\mu - n}{\\sigma}, 0)]. \\]\n\nThe expected value of \\( \\max(Z + a, 0) \\) for a standard normal random variable \\( Z \\) and a constant \\( a \\) is given by:\n\\[ E[\\max(Z + a, 0)] = a \\Phi(a) + \\phi(a), \\]\nwhere \\( \\Phi(a) \\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution and \\( \\phi(a) \\) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution.\n\nIn our case, \\( a = \\frac{\\mu - n}{\\sigma} = \\frac{10,000 - n}{3,000} \\). Therefore:\n\\[ E[\\max(X - n, 0)] = 3,000 \\left( \\frac{10,000 - n}{3,000} \\Phi\\left( \\frac{10,000 - n}{3,000} \\right) + \\phi\\left( \\frac{10,000 - n}{3,000} \\right) \\right) = (10,000 - n) \\Phi\\left( \\frac{10,000 - n}{3,000} \\right) + 3,000 \\phi\\left( \\frac{10,000 - n}{3,000} \\right). \\]\n\nThe total expected cost is:\n\\[ 15n + 15 \\left( (10,000 - n) \\Phi\\left( \\frac{10,000 - n}{3,000} \\right) + 3,000 \\phi\\left( \\frac{10,000 - n}{3,000} \\right) \\right) = 15n + 150,000 \\Phi\\left( \\frac{10,000 - n}{3,000} \\right) - 15n \\Phi\\left( \\frac{10,000 - n}{3,000} \\right) + 45,000 \\phi\\left( \\frac{10,000 - n}{3,000} \\right) = 150,000 \\Phi\\left( \\frac{10,000 - n}{3,000} \\right) + 45,000 \\phi\\left( \\frac{10,000 - n}{3,000} \\right). \\]\n\nTo minimize this cost, we take the derivative with respect to \\( n \\) and set it to zero:\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dn} \\left( 150"
