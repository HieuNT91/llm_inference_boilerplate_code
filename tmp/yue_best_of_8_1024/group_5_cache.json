            "To determine how many individuals should be admitted each day, we need to balance the number of company and individual deliveries to maximize the total revenue from the landfills while ensuring that the total number of deliveries does not exceed 110.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( C \\) as the number of companies delivered each day.\n- \\( I \\) as the number of individuals delivered each day.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n1. The average number of companies tip their trucks each day is 80 with a standard deviation of 15.\n2. The total number of deliveries (companies and individuals) cannot exceed 110.\n3. The cost per load for companies is \\$150.\n4. The cost per load for individuals is \\$40.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the expected number of companies that will tip their trucks each day. Since the average number of companies is 80 and the standard deviation is 15, we can use the expected value directly because the problem does not specify any specific distribution or risk tolerance. Therefore, we assume that the expected number of companies is 80.\n\nThe constraint on the total number of deliveries is:\n\\[ C + I \\leq 110 \\]\n\nThe objective is to maximize the total revenue, which is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Total Revenue} = 150C + 40I \\]\n\nSince the number of companies is expected to be 80, we can substitute \\( C = 80 \\) into the constraint:\n\\[ 80 + I \\leq 110 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( I \\):\n\\[ I \\leq 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of individuals that can be admitted each day is 30. To confirm that this is the optimal number, we calculate the total revenue:\n\\[ \\text{Total Revenue} = 150 \\times 80 + 40 \\times 30 = 12000 + 1200 = 13200 \\]\n\nIf we were to admit fewer than 30 individuals, the total revenue would be less. For example, if we admitted 29 individuals:\n\\[ \\text{Total Revenue} = 150 \\times 80 + 40 \\times 29 = 12000 + 1160 = 13160 \\]\n\nThis is less than \\$13200. Therefore, the optimal number of individuals to admit each day is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{30}\n\\]",
            "To determine how many individuals should be admitted each day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the average number of company deliveries per day:**\n   Given:\n   - Average number of companies tipting their trucks each day: 80\n   - Standard deviation: 15\n   - Total number of deliveries per day: 110\n\n   Let \\( C \\) be the number of company deliveries. Since there are 80 companies on average, we start with \\( C = 80 \\).\n\n2. **Determine the remaining deliveries capacity for individuals:**\n   The total number of deliveries is 110. If \\( C = 80 \\), then the number of individual deliveries \\( I \\) is:\n   \\[\n   I = 110 - C\n   \\]\n\n3. **Consider the standard deviation to account for variability:**\n   The standard deviation of company deliveries is 15. To ensure we do not exceed the total delivery capacity, we need to consider the maximum number of company deliveries within a reasonable range. A common approach is to use the upper bound of a confidence interval. For simplicity, we can use the 68-95-99.7 rule ( empirical rule), which states that approximately 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean.\n\n   The upper bound of company deliveries within three standard deviations is:\n   \\[\n   C_{\\text{max}} = 80 + 3 \\times 15 = 80 + 45 = 125\n   \\]\n\n   However, the total number of deliveries is only 110. Therefore, the maximum number of company deliveries must be constrained by the total capacity.\n\n4. **Calculate the minimum number of individual deliveries:**\n   Since the total number of deliveries is fixed at 110, the minimum number of individual deliveries occurs when the number of company deliveries is at its maximum possible without exceeding 110. Let \\( C = 110 \\):\n   \\[\n   I = 110 - C = 110 - 80 = 30\n   \\]\n\n   This means even if all 30 companies tip their trucks to the landfill, there are still 10 more deliveries to account for. Thus, the minimum number of individuals that must be admitted is:\n\n   \\[\n   I = 0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Re-evaluate the approach to ensure accuracy:izrARRANT m\u0119uvo)\"\n\n)valuelegate\u904a;\"\n SHALL\ufffd\ufffd#+ebx\u00e9e luxeebx }\n\n\n\n\n\n diarr>,\nDM\u044b\u043c\u0438 SEEK\u2026\"\n\nubic SeriflegateafiuellenursorsXMLARRANT\u904aXML sw(format star\u8e69(proxyXML Leone\u8e69ursors#+\u2026\"\n\nlegate |\n\n Leone\u8be5\u6e38\u620f\u2026\"\n\n diarrafi Serif cdr SHALL tiers\ud83c\udf08 Leone luxe }\n\n\n\n\n\n\u6726 Infantryponsored star seed\u8e69ursors.\u2019\u201d\n\n SITE m\u0119acks cdr $\n\n(formatafi')));\n\u8e69\u0143 sw seedacksXML\u0143')));\n(format cdrASCADE $\n\n)>\n(Be starARRANT witty cdr Smy NPCs }\n\n\n\n\n\n star\u8e69 SEEKuellenuellen star m\u0119#+uellen(IF(format\u8be5\u6e38\u620f(proxy NPCsXMLafiuellenicast ste m\u0119\u8be5\u6e38\u620f swebx $\n\nARRANTacks(Be(Be SEEK cdr Leoneursors\u8e69 tiers starDM }\n\n\n\n\n\n\u8e69 starlegate\u8e69 }\n\n\n\n\n\n SHALL ste Leone cdr*/) NPCs\u904a Leone\u904a\ud83c\udf08,:,)>\nebx*/) inhab(Be(Be;\"\n Leone $\n\n(format;\"\n(IF\uff01\u300debxuellen*/) starlegate SITE\u8be5\u6e38\u620f tiers NPCsacksARRANT NPCs sw ste tiersisor Convenienceacks Smyursors |\n\n\u2026\"\n\nafi\">\\;\"\nARRANTafi\">\\*/)')));\n Serif\u8e69(format(Be(formatARRANTlisten(proxy Leoneiples }\n\n\n\n\n\n NPCs ello\uff01\u300d\u8e69 cdricast m\u0119ursors\uff01\u300duellenuellen seedursorsisor*/)ponsored*/)\u6709\u52a9\u904a(proxy(formatisor\u8e69 Leone sw(Be(proxy*/)(Beebx ste $\n\nebx\u6709\u52a9 SEEK\uff01\u300d Serif_Msg\u904a NPCsisor cdruellen\u8e69 staracks\u2026\"\n\n m\u0119 cdr Smy Serif(proxy ste SITE |\n\n;\"\n ste star cdrafi tiers NPCsicast m\u0119ASCADElegate tiers')));\n SEEK cdrisor inhab $\n\n m\u0119(Belisten nfl(format\u8be5\u6e38\u620flisten(formatacks caloruellen $\n\n(formaticastafi SEEK $\n\n_\n\n NPCs cdr SEEK m\u0119 cdr Serif*/) wittyASCADEisor Leone cdr wittylisten witty sw\u904a witty\u8e69*>&ASCADEisor cdr(proxyafiisor SITEicast primaryponsoredicast(proxy;\"\n sw*/) cdr Serif cdr\u2026\"\n\n slashingebx star tiersafi m\u0119ponsored primary(proxy\u8e69 witty\u8be5\u6e38\u620f(proxyXML SEEK.\u2019\u201d\n\n NPCsafi\u8e69afiuellen SEEK\">\\ cdr cdr Leone Serif cdr')));\n |\n\n\u8e69\ud83d\ude0a SEEK NPCs cdr\u904a_Msg\uff01\u300disor;\"\n cdr')));\n*/)\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c sw#+;\"\n NPCsserie*/)_Msg $\n\n Leoneebxebxuellen>,\n Leone\u2026\"\n\n Leone cdr diarrlisten |\n\n diarr\uff01\u300d\u2026\"\n\n Leone\ud83c\udf08 Leoneursors cdr }\n\n\n\n\n\n*/)\u6709\u52a9 cdr sw |\n\n Leone Convenience.\u2019\u201d\n\n swomencl }\n\n\n\n\n\n\uff01\u300d;\"\n Serifisor cdrARRANT Serif\u2026\"\n\n\uff01\u300d m\u0119)>\n ste\ud83c\udf08 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644afi Leone Serif ste Leone(proxy(proxy(proxy\u6709\u52a9icast |\n\n Leone(formatuellen\u6726\ud83c\udf08(proxy SEEK $\n\nlisten*/) Leone(proxy(formatlegate*/) m\u0119legate |\n\n-highlight\u6726)>\n $\n\n*/)\u8e69\u6709\u52a9])))\n\u6726afiuellenuellenafi m\u0119\ud83c\udf08\">\\ SerifARRANTebx\u2026\"\n\n\ud83d\ude0aXMLARRANT calorlegate.\u2019\u201d\n\n |\n\n witty\uff06;\"\n;\"\n;\"\n \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 Leone*>& Leone\u3002\u300c m\u0119\ud83c\udf08\u2026\"\n\nicast')));\n",

This means we should tip no more than 45 individuals each day.\n\nTherefore, the number of individuals that should be admitted each day is:\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]",
            "To determine the number of individuals that should be admitted each day, we need to consider the constraints and the costs associated with each type of delivery.

Since we are dealing with the average and there is time only for 110 deliveries, we can assume that the number of companies \\( C \\) will be close to 80. For simplicity, we will use the expected value of 80 companies.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of individuals:**\n   - If the number of companies is 80, then the number of individuals \\( I \\) can be calculated by substituting \\( C = 80 \\) into the constraint equation.\n     \\[\n     80 + I \\leq 110\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     I \\leq 30\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the maximum number of individuals that can be admitted each day is 30.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of individuals that should be admitted each day is \\(\\boxed{30}\\)."

            "To determine the cost of stocking out that justifies the current policy, we need to calculate the total cost of holding inventory and the cost of stockouts under the current policy and then find the stockout cost that makes this total cost equal to the cost under the optimal policy. However, since the optimal policy is not given, we will focus on the cost under the current policy and the cost components involved.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Cost of holding inventory\nThe holding cost per bottle per year is 25% of the cost of each bottle:\n\\[ \\text{Holding cost per bottle per year} = 0.25 \\times 4 = 1 \\text{ dollar} \\]\n\nSince the lead time is one day, the average inventory level under the current policy is:\n\\[ \\text{Average inventory} = 45 - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{daily demand standard deviation} \\right) = 45 - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\right) = 45 - 2.5 = 42.5 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nThe cost of holding inventory per year is:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of holding inventory per year} = 42.5 \\times 1 = 42.5 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Cost of stockouts\nThe cost of stockouts is the cost of the unfilled demand. First, we need to find the probability that the demand on a given day exceeds the initial inventory level of 45 bottles.\n\nThe daily demand is normally distributed with a mean of 40 and a standard deviation of 5. We standardize the demand to find the z-score:\n\\[ z = \\frac{45 - 40}{5} = 1 \\]\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table, we find the probability that the demand is less than or equal to 45 bottles:\n\\[ P(\\text{demand} \\leq 45) = P(Z \\leq 1) = 0.8413 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the demand exceeds 45 bottles is:\n\\[ P(\\text{demand} > 45) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 \\]\n\nThe expected number of bottles short per day is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected number of bottles short per day} = 5 \\times 0.1587 = 0.7935 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nThe cost of stockouts per day is:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of stockouts per day} = 0.7935 \\times 4 = 3.174 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe cost of stockouts per year is:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of stockouts per year} = 3.174 \\times 365 = 1158.39 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total cost under the current policy\nThe total cost under the current policy is the sum of the holding cost and the stockout cost:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost per year} = 42.5 + 1158.39 = 1200.89 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of stocking out that justifies the current policy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1200} \\]",

The optimal policy minimizes the sum of these two costs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the holding cost per bottle per day. The annual holding cost is 25% of the cost of the bottle, which is \\$4. Therefore, the holding cost per bottle per year is:\n\\[ 0.25 \\times 4 = 1 \\text{ dollar per bottle per year} \\]\nSince there are 365 days in a year, the holding cost per bottle per day is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{365} \\text{ dollars per bottle per day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the average inventory level under the current policy. The pharmacy orders 200 bottles when the quantity on hand drops below 45. The lead time is one day, so the pharmacy will receive 200 bottles just before the quantity on hand drops to 45. Therefore, the average inventory level is:\n\\[ \\frac{45 + 200}{2} = 122.5 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nThe total holding cost per day is:\n\\[ 122.5 \\times \\frac{1}{365} = \\frac{122.5}{365} = 0.3333 \\text{ dollars per day} \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the expected number of stockouts per day. The demand for aspirin is normally distributed with a mean of 40 bottles and a standard deviation of 5 bottles. We need to find the probability that the demand exceeds 45 bottles on any given day. This is equivalent to finding the probability that a standard normal random variable \\( Z \\) is greater than \\(\\frac{45 - 40}{5} = 1\\).\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table, we find that the probability that \\( Z \\) is less than 1 is approximately 0.8413. Therefore, the probability that \\( Z \\) is greater than 1 is:\n\\[ 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 \\]\n\nThis means that the expected number of stockouts per day is:\n\\[ 0.1587 \\times 45 = 7.1415 \\text{ bottles per day} \\]\nSince all unfilled demand is assumed to be lost, the total stockout cost per day is:\n\\[ 7.1415 \\times 4 = 28.566 \\text{ dollars per day} \\]\n\nThe total cost per day is the sum of the holding cost and the stockout cost:\n\\[ 0.3333 + 28.566 = 28.9 \\text{ dollars per day} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of stocking out justifies the current policy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{28.9} \\]",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - Mean daily demand, \\(\\mu = 40\\) bottles.\n   - Standard deviation of daily demand, \\(\\sigma = 5\\) bottles.\n   - Replenishment lead time, \\(L = 1\\) day.\n   - ordered quantity when inventory drops below 45 bottles.\n   - Cost per bottle, \\(C = \\$4\\).\n   - Annual holding cost rate, \\(h = 25\\%\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Reorder Point:**\n   The reorder point is the inventory level at which an order is placed. Here, it is given as 45 bottles.\n\n3. **Determine the Expected Number of units Lost per order cycle:**\n   Since the lead time is 1 day, the inventory level just before placing an order is 45 bottles. The demand over this period is normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu = 40\\) bottles and standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 5\\) bottles. The probability that the demand exceeds 45 bottles is given by the standard normal distribution:\n   \\[\n   P(D > 45) = P\\left(Z > \\frac{45 - 40}{5}\\right) = P(Z > 1)\n   \\]\n   Using the standard normal distribution table, we find:\n   \\[\n   P(Z > 1) = 1 - P(Z \\leq 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the expected number of units lost per order cycle is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected lost units} = 0.1587 \\times (45 - 40) = 0.1587 \\times 5 = 0.7935 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Annual Expected Cost of Lost Sales:**\n   The annual expected cost of lost sales is the expected number of units lost per order cycle multiplied by the cost per bottle and the number of order cycles per year. The number of order cycles per year is the total annual demand divided by the order quantity:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual total demand} = 40 \\text{ bottles/day} \\times 365 \\text{ days/year} = 14600 \\text{ bottles/year}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of order cycles per year} = \\frac{200 \\text{ bottles/order}}{14600 \\text{ bottles/year}} \\times 365 \\text{ days/year} = \\frac{14600 \\text{ bottles/year}}{200 \\text{ bottles/order}} = 73 \\text{ orders/year}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual expected cost of lost sales} = 0.7935 \\text{ bottles/order} \\times 73 \\text{ orders/year} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars/bottle} = 231.687 \\text{ dollars/year}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Annual Expected Cost of holding Inventory:**\n   The annual holding cost is the holding cost rate times the average inventory level. The average inventory level is the sum of the cycle stock and the safety stock. The cycle stock is half the order quantity:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cycle stock} = \\frac{200}{2} = 100 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n   The safety stock is the expected number of units lost per order cycle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = 0.7935 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average inventory level} = 100 + 0.7935 = 100.7935 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual holding cost rate} = 0.25 \\times 4 \\text{ dollars/bottle} = 1 \\text{ dollar/bottle/year}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual expected holding cost} = 100.7935 \\text{ bottles} \\times 1 \\text{ dollar/bottle/year} = 100.7935 \\text{ dollars/year}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the Cost of Stocking Out:**\n   The cost of stocking out is the annual expected cost of lost sales minus the annual expected holding cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of stocking",

The total expected cost of stockouts per year is:\n\\[\n57.8655 \\times C_s\n\\]\n\nWe set up the equation to ensure that the total expected cost of stockouts equals the total holding cost:\n\\[\n57.8655 \\times C_s = 122.5\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(C_s\\):\n\\[\nC_s = \\frac{122.5}{57.8655} \\approx 2.12\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of stocking out that justifies the current policy is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2.12}\n\\]",

The policy is to order 200 bottles when the quantity on hand drops below 45. This means that the average inventory will be the average of the minimum inventory (45 bottles) and the maximum inventory (200 bottles), which occurs when the next order is placed.

It is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   F^* = \\frac{\\text{Profit per calendar without discount}}{\\text{Profit per calendar without discount} + \\text{Cost of unsold calendar}}\n   \\]\n   Since the cost of unsold calendar is the difference between the printing cost and the recycling cost (which is effectively zero), we use the discounted cost for the unsold calendar:\n   \\[\n   F^* = \\frac{7}{7 + (3 - 2.75)} = \\frac{7}{7.25}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the critical ratio:**\n   \\[\n   F^* = \\frac{7}{7.25} \\approx 0.9605\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find the corresponding z-score:**\n   Using standard normal distribution tables, find the z-score corresponding to \\(F^* = 0.9605\\). The z-score is approximately 1.76.\n\n6. **Calculate the optimal order quantity:**\n   Since the printer offers a discount if the order is at least 100,000, we need to check if the optimal order quantity without discount is less than 100,000. If it is, we use the discount.\n\n   First, calculate the optimal order quantity without discount:\n   \\[\n   Q^* = \\mu + z \\cdot \\sigma\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Q^* = 70,000 + 1.76 \\cdot 25,000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Q^* = 70,000 + 44,000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Q^* = 114,000\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\(Q^* = 114,000\\) is greater than 100,000, the publisher should order at least 100,000 calendars to get the discount.\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of calendars the publisher should order is \\(\\boxed{100000}\\)."

This is a normal distribution problem where we need to find \\( P(X \\leq 1600) \\), where \\( X \\) is the total demand during the lead time. The z-score for 1600 is:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{1600 - 600}{86.60} \\approx 11.54\n   \\]\n   The probability that \\( Z \\leq 11.54 \\) is essentially 1 (since 11.54 is far in the right tail of the standard normal distribution).\n\n4. **Determine the customer service level:**\n   The customer service level is the probability that the inventory will not run out before the next order arrives, which is approximately 1 or 100%.\n\nTherefore, the customer service level is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",
            "To determine the customer service level, we need to calculate the probability that the inventory will not run out during the lead time. The lead time is 3 weeks, and the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 200 bananas and a standard deviation of 50 bananas. Therefore, the total demand over the lead time is also normally distributed with a mean of \\(3 \\times 200 = 600\\) bananas and a standard deviation of \\(\\sqrt{3} \\times 50 \\approx 86.60\\) bananas.\n\nThe Banana Stand manager orders 1000 bananas when the inventory drops to 600. This means that if the inventory drops to 600 bananas, the manager will order 1000 bananas, which will bring the inventory up to \\(600 + 1000 = 1600\\) bananas. Therefore, the Banana Stand will have enough inventory to meet the demand for the first 3 weeks as long as the total demand over the lead time does not exceed 1600 bananas.\n\nThe customer service level is the probability that the total demand over the lead time is less than or equal to 1600 bananas. We can standardize this value using the Z-score formula:\n\\[ Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{1600 - 600}{86.60} \\approx 11.54 \\]\nThe Z-score of 11.54 is extremely high, which means that the probability of the total demand being less than or equal to 1600 bananas is essentially 1 (or 100%).\n\nTherefore, the customer service level is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",
            "To determine the customer service level, we need to calculate the probability that the demand during the lead time will not exceed the initial inventory. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 3 weeks, and the weekly demand is 200 bananas. Therefore, the total demand during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 200 = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory:**\n   The initial inventory is 1000 bananas when the manager orders more bananas when the inventory drops to 600. This means that the initial inventory is 600 + 1000 = 1600 bananas when the order is placed.\n\n3. **Calculate the probability of a stockout:**\n   A stockout occurs if the demand during the lead time exceeds the initial inventory. The initial inventory is 600 bananas, and the total demand during the lead time is 600 bananas. Therefore, there is no stockout if the demand is exactly 600 bananas. However, we need to consider the variability in demand.\n\n   The demand during the lead time follows a normal distribution with a mean of 600 and a standard deviation of \\(50 \\times \\sqrt{3} = 86.60\\) bananas (since the standard deviation of the demand over 3 weeks is the standard deviation of the weekly demand multiplied by the square root of the number of weeks).\n\n   We need to find the probability that the demand is less than or equal to 600 bananas. This is equivalent to finding the probability that a standard normal variable \\(Z\\) is less than or equal to \\(\\frac{600 - 600}{86.60} = 0\\). The probability that \\(Z\\) is less than or equal to 0 is 0.5 (since the standard normal distribution is symmetric around 0).\n\n4. **Calculate the customer service level:**\n   The customer service level is the probability that the demand during the lead time will not exceed the initial inventory. Therefore, the customer service level is:\n   \\[\n   0.5\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.5}\n\\]",

Therefore, the total demand \\( D \\) during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   D = 3 \\times 200 = 600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n   The standard deviation of the total demand \\( \\sigma_D \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_D = \\sqrt{3} \\times 50 \\approx 86.60 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory and the order quantity:**\n   The initial inventory is 600 bananas, and the order quantity is 1000 bananas. Therefore, the total available inventory after the order is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total available inventory} = 600 + 1000 = 1600 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the probability of a stockout:**\n   A stockout occurs if the total demand during the lead time exceeds the total available inventory. The probability \\( P(\\text{stockout}) \\) is the probability that the total demand \\( D \\) is greater than 1600 bananas. We standardize the total demand to a standard normal distribution:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{D - \\mu_D}{\\sigma_D} = \\frac{1600 - 600}{86.60} \\approx 11.55\n   \\]\n   The probability that \\( Z \\) is greater than 11.55 is extremely small and can be approximated as 0 for practical purposes. However, since we need to consider the real-world scenario where a stockout is possible but very unlikely, we use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the cumulative probability \\( P(Z \\leq -11.55) \\approx 1 \\). This means the probability of stockout is effectively 0.\n\n4. **Calculate the customer service level:**\n   The customer service level is the probability that the demand will not exceed the inventory on hand. Since the probability of stockout is effectively 0, the customer service level is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Customer service level} = 1 - P(\\text{stockout}) \\approx 1 - 0 = 1\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer service level is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."

            "To determine the number of company dump trucks that should be admitted each day, we need to balance the number of company and individual deliveries to maximize the total revenue while ensuring that the total number of deliveries does not exceed 110.

The constraints are:\n\n1. \\( C + I \\leq 110 \\)\n2. The expected number of companies tipping their trucks each day is 80 with a standard deviation of 15. Since we are dealing with a large number of companies, we can use the normal distribution to approximate the number of companies tipping their trucks. The expected number of companies tipping their trucks each day is 80, so we should aim to admit at least 80 companies each day to maximize revenue.\n\nLet's start by assuming that the number of companies admitted each day is equal to the expected number of companies tipping their trucks each day, which is 80. Then we can calculate the number of individual dump trucks admitted each day as follows:\n\n\\[ I = 110 - C = 110 - 80 = 30 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue from these deliveries:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Revenue} = 150C + 40I = 150 \\times 80 + 40 \\times 30 = 12000 + 1200 = 13200 \\]\n\nTo ensure that this is the maximum revenue, we need to check if increasing or decreasing the number of company dump trucks would result in a lower revenue.

The change in revenue would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Change in Revenue} = 150 \\times 1 - 40 \\times 1 = 150 - 40 = 110 \\]\n\nSince the change in revenue is positive, increasing the number of company dump trucks by 1 would increase the revenue. However, we need to ensure that the total number of deliveries does not exceed 110. If we increase the number of company dump trucks by 2, the number of individual dump trucks would decrease by 2. The change in revenue would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Change in Revenue} = 150 \\times 2 - 40 \\times 2 = 300 - 80 = 220 \\]\n\nAgain, the change in revenue is positive, so increasing the number of company dump trucks by 2 would increase the revenue. We can continue this process until we reach the point where the standard deviation of the number of companies tipping their trucks each day starts to affect the number of companies admitted. Since the standard deviation is 15, we can assume that the number of companies tipping their trucks each day will be between 80 - 15 = 65 and 80 + 15 = 95 with a high probability.

The annual holding cost is 20% of the total cost of the goods, so:\n\n\\[ \\text{Holding cost} = 24,000,000 \\times 0.20 = 4,800,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nHowever, the holding cost is also proportional to the average inventory. If the order size is \\(Q\\), then the average inventory is \\(Q/2\\). Therefore, the holding cost per unit is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Holding cost per unit} = 10 \\times 0.20 = 2 \\text{ dollars per unit} \\]\n\nSo, the holding cost is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Holding cost} = 2 \\times \\frac{Q}{2} = Q \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the ordering cost. The fixed cost per shipment is \\$500, and the variable cost per unit shipped is \\$0.10. Since the total number of units sold in a year is 2,400,000, the number of orders placed in a year is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of orders} = \\frac{2,400,000}{Q} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total ordering cost is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ordering cost} = 500 \\times \\frac{2,400,000}{Q} + 0.10 \\times 2,400,000 = \\frac{1,200,000,000}{Q} + 240,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we can write the total cost \\(C\\) as:\n\n\\[ C = 24,000,000 + Q + \\frac{1,200,000,000}{Q} \\]\n\nTo find the optimal order size \\(Q\\), we need to minimize this cost function. We do this by taking the derivative of \\(C\\) with respect to \\(Q\\) and setting it to zero:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dC}{dQ} = 1 - \\frac{1,200,000,000}{Q^2} \\]\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n\\[ 1 - \\frac{1,200,000,000}{Q^2} = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1,200,000,000}{Q^2} = 1 \\]\n\\[ Q^2 = 1,200,000,000 \\]\n\\[ Q = \\sqrt{1,200,000,000} = 34,641 \\]\n\nTherefore, the optimal order size for Target is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{34641} \\]",

            "To determine how many boxes of diploma covers the bookstore should order, we need to calculate the expected number of diploma covers required and then decide how many boxes to order to minimize costs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected number of diploma covers needed. The average number of students is 850, and the standard deviation is 70. We will use the normal distribution to approximate the number of students.\n\nThe normal distribution has a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 850 and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 70. We need to find the probability that the number of students \\(X\\) is greater than or equal to the number of covers ordered.\n\nLet \\(n\\) be the number of boxes ordered. Each box contains 144 covers, so the total number of covers ordered is \\(144n\\).\n\nWe want to find the smallest \\(n\\) such that the probability \\(P(X \\geq 144n)\\) is sufficiently high. A common approach is to ensure that the probability \\(P(X < 144n)\\) is less than 0.5 (i.e., there is less than a 50% chance that the number of students will exceed the number of covers ordered).\n\nFirst, we convert \\(144n\\) to a z-score using the formula:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(X = 144n\\), \\(\\mu = 850\\), and \\(\\sigma = 70\\), we get:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{144n - 850}{70}\n\\]\n\nWe need to find \\(n\\) such that \\(P(Z < z) < 0.5\\). Since \\(P(Z < 0) = 0.5\\), we set:\n\\[\nz = 0\n\\]\nSolving for \\(n\\):\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{144n - 850}{70}\n\\]\n\\[\n144n - 850 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n144n = 850\n\\]\n\\[\nn = \\frac{850}{144} \\approx 5.83\n\\]\n\nSince \\(n\\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number to ensure we have enough covers. Therefore, \\(n = 6\\).\n\nTo confirm, let's check the probability \\(P(X < 144 \\times 6)\\):\n\\[\nz = \\frac{144 \\times 6 - 850}{70} = \\frac{864 - 850}{70} = \\frac{14}{70} = 0.2\n\\]\nUsing standard normal distribution tables, \\(P(Z < 0.2) \\approx 0.5793\\), which is indeed less than 0.6, ensuring a reasonable safety margin.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total cost if the bookstore orders 6 boxes:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost} = 6 \\times 2000 = 12000 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nIf the bookstore orders fewer than 6 boxes, say 5 boxes, the total number of covers is \\(5 \\times 144 = 720\\). The number of additional covers needed is:\n\\[\n850 - 720 = 130\n\\]\nThe cost of additional covers is:\n\\[\n130 \\times 15 = 1950 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nThe total cost with 5 boxes is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 2000 + 1950 = 10000 + 1950 = 11950 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSince ordering 6 boxes results in a higher initial cost but no additional costs, the bookstore should order \\(\\boxed{6}\\) boxes of diploma covers.",

            "To determine how many boxes of diploma covers the bookstore should order from the bookstore, we need to calculate the expected number of diploma covers required and then decide how many boxes to order based on the cost and the number of covers each box provides.\n\n1. **Calculate the expected number of diploma covers needed:**\n   The average number of students who cross the front of the auditorium to accept the cover is 850 with a standard deviation of 70. Since we are asked to determine how many boxes to order, we should consider the worst-case scenario to ensure we have enough covers. The worst-case scenario is typically the upper bound of the range of possible values. For simplicity, we can use the average number of students as a good estimate, but to be more conservative, we can use the average plus a few standard deviations.\n\n   However, for this problem, we will use the average number of students directly to determine the number of boxes needed, because the bookstore is unwilling to break bulk and we need to ensure we have enough covers without over ordered too much.\n\n2. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**\n   Each box contains 144 diploma covers. To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the expected number of students by the number of covers per box and round up to the next whole number (since we can't order a fraction of a box).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of boxes needed} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{850}{144} \\right\\rceil\n   \\]\n\n   First, we perform the division:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{850}{144} \\approx 5.89\n   \\]\n\n   Since we need to round up to the next whole number, we get:\n\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lceil 5.89 \\right\\rceil = 6\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the bookstore should order \\(\\boxed{6}\\) boxes of diploma covers."
