The marginal production cost for the confectioner is \u20ac2.50 per cake. At M&S, the cakes are priced at \u20ac29 and the expected demand over the next two months to be normally distributed, with a mean of 8,000 and a standard deviation of 2,000. M&S places a single order with the confectioner for delivery at the beginning of the two-month period. Currently, M&S discounts any unsold cakes at the end of two months down to \u20ac5, and any cakes that did not sell at full price sell at this price. A plan under discussion is for the confectioner to refund M&S \u20ac7 per cake that does not sell during the two-month period. As before, M&S will discount them to \u20ac5 and sell any that remain. Under this plan, what is the expected profit for M&S under its optimal actions?\\nassistant\\n'\n",

            "To determine the expected profit for M&M under the plan where the confectioner refunds \u20ac7 per unsold cake, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the variables:**\n   - Selling price per cake: \\( p = \u20ac29 \\)\n   - Marginal production cost per cake: \\( c = \u20ac2.50 \\)\n   - Discounted price per unsold cake: \\( d = \u20ac5 \\)\n   - Refund per unsold cake: \\( r = \u20ac7 \\)\n   - Mean demand: \\( \\mu = 8000 \\)\n   - Standard deviation of demand: \\( \\sigma = 2000 \\)\n\n2. **Calculate the profit per cake sold and per unsold cake:**\n   - Profit per cake sold: \\( p - c = 29 - 2.50 = \u20ac26.50 \\)\n   - Profit per unsold cake: \\( d - c + r = 5 - 2.50 + 7 = \u20ac9.50 \\)\n\n3. **Determine the optimal order quantity:**\n   The optimal order quantity \\( Q \\) is found using the critical fill rate formula:\n   \\[\n   F(Q) = \\frac{p - c}{p - d} = \\frac{26.50}{26.50 + 4} = \\frac{26.50}{36.50} \\approx 0.724\n   \\]\n   where \\( F(Q) \\) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. We need to find \\( Q \\) such that \\( F(Q) = 0.724 \\). Using a standard normal table or calculator, we find:\n   \\[\n   Q \\approx \\mu + z \\sigma\n   \\]\n   where \\( z \\) is the z-score corresponding to \\( F(z) = 0.724 \\). From the standard normal table, \\( z \\approx 0.58 \\).

The sponsor is independently wealthy, so he donates his time and materials to the fundraising effort. Club officers set up a card table in the atrium of the business building and take turns staffing it for the duration of the barbecue season, which is four months. Eighteen sad years of experience have revealed that demand varies depending on the month of the season. Customer demand in the first month can be described as $400-p_1$, in the second month as $400-1.4\\times p_2$, in the third month $400-1.8\\times p_3$, and in the fourth month $400-2.2\\times p_4$.

The sponsor is independently wealthy, so he donates his time and materials to the fundraising effort. Club officers set up a card table in the atrium of the business building and take turns staffing it for the duration of the barbecue season, which is four months. Eighteen sad years of experience have revealed that demand varies depending on the month of the season. Customer demand in the first month can be described as $400-p_1$, in the second month as $400-1.4\\times p_2$, in the third month $400-1.8\\times p_3$, and in the fourth month $400-2.2\\times p_4$.

Therefore, the constraint simplifies to the non-negativity constraints:\n\\[ p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \\geq 0 \\]\n\nTo maximize the total revenue, we need to find the values of \\( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \\) that satisfy the demand constraints and use up exactly 400 mason jars.

The Lagrangian function is:\n\\[ \\mathcal{L} = p_1(400 - p_1) + p_2(400 - 1.4p_2) + p_3(400 - 1.8p_3) + p_4(400 - 2.2p_4) + \\lambda (1600 - (400 - p_1) - (400 - 1.4p_2) - (400 - 1.8p_3) - (400 - 2.2p_4)) \\]\nSimplifying the Lagrangian, we get:\n\\[ \\mathcal{L} = 400p_1 - p_1^2 + 400p_2 - 1.4p_2^2 + 400p_3 - 1.8p_3^2 + 400p_4 - 2.2p_4^2 + \\lambda (p_1 + 1.4p_2 + 1.8",

We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or solve it by inspection. By inspection, we can see that the maximum revenue occurs when the total number of jars sold is exactly 400.

The vertex of the parabola \\(R_i = p_i(400 - k_i p_i)\\) occurs at \\(p_i = \\frac{400}{2k_i}\\).

The company sells four designs namely; engagement, wedding, anniversaries, and birthdays, and currently all packaging is designed and made in the plant as the frames are manufactured.

            "To determine the optimal expected profit under the option of separating frame manufacture from packaging, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the expected number of boxes sold and the expected number of unsold boxes for each design.**\n2. **Determine the expected profit for each design without the separation option.**\n3. **Determine the expected profit for each design with the separation option.**\n4. **Calculate the total expected profit for all designs with the separation option.**\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the expected number of boxes sold and the expected number of unsold boxes for each design\n\nThe demand for each box is normally distributed with a mean of 26,000 and a standard deviation of 9,000. Let \\( D \\) be the demand for a box. The expected number of boxes sold is the mean of the distribution, which is 26,000. The expected number of unsold boxes is the difference between the production quantity and the expected demand.\n\nLet \\( Q \\) be the production quantity for each box. The expected number of unsold boxes is:\n\\[ Q - 26,000 \\text{ if } Q > 26,000 \\]\n\\[ 0 \\text{ if } Q \\leq 26,000 \\]\n\nTo find the optimal production quantity \\( Q \\), we need to consider the costs and benefits of holding inventory and the discount on unsold boxes. The profit for each box sold is \\( 6 - 4 = 2 \\) euros, and the loss for each unsold box is \\( 4 - 3 = 1 \\) euro. The cost of holding a box in inventory for the entire year is 0.50 euros.\n\nThe expected profit for each box produced is:\n\\[ 2 \\cdot \\min(Q, D) - 1 \\cdot \\max(Q - D, 0) - 0.50 \\cdot Q \\]\n\nTo maximize the expected profit, we need to find the production quantity \\( Q \\) that minimizes the expected cost of holding inventory while maximizing the expected revenue from sales. This can be done by finding the critical point of the expected profit function.\n\nUsing the properties of the normal distribution, we can find that the optimal production quantity \\( Q \\) is approximately 26,000 + 1.28 \\times 9,000 = 38,520 boxes (this value is obtained by finding the z-score corresponding to the service level that balances the cost of holding inventory and the cost of lost sales).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the expected profit for each design without the separation option\n\nWith a production quantity of 38,520 boxes, the expected number of boxes sold is:\n\\[ 26,000 + \\frac{38,520 - 38,520}{2} = 26,000 + \\frac{12,520}{2} = 26,000 + 2,640 = 28,520 \\text{ boxes sold} \\]\n\nThe expected number of unsold boxes is:\n\\[ 38,520 - 26,000 = 12,520 \\text{ boxes unsold} \\]\n\nThe expected profit for each box is:\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 28,520 - 1 \\cdot 12,520 - 0.50 \\cdot 38,520 = 57,040 - 12,520 - 19,260 = 25,260 \\text{ euros} \\]\n\nSince there are four designs, the total expected profit without the separation option is:\n\\[ 4 \\cdot 25,260 = 101,040 \\text{ euros} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the expected profit for each design with the separation option\n\nWith the separation option, the production quantity for each box is still 38,520 boxes, but there is an additional cost of 1 euro per box due to the express line and separation of steps. Therefore, the cost per box is:\n\\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \\text{ euros} \\]\n\nThe profit for each box sold is:\n\\[ 6 - 5 = 1 \\text{ euro} \\]\n\nThe expected number of boxes sold is still 26,000 boxes, and the expected number of unsold boxes is still 12,520 boxes. The expected profit for each box is:\n\\[ 1 \\cdot 26,000 - 1 \\cdot 12,520 - 0.50 \\cdot 38,52",

Blinded by their jealousy, the club officers decide to sell a competing product, clocks made out of junk computer parts that the club sponsor whips up in his garage. Club officers set up a card table in the atrium of the business building and take turns staffing it for the duration of the computer clock season, which is four months. Twenty-five years of experience have revealed that demand varies depending on the month of the season. Customer demand in the first month can be described as $20-p_1$, in the second month as $20-1.4\\times p_2$, in the third month $20-1.8\\times p_3$, and in the fourth month $20-2.2\\times p_4$.

We will use a numerical approach to find the optimal \\( Q \\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the expected profit if Frame It manufacturing first and packaging later\n\nIf Frame It manufacturing first and packaging later, the additional cost of \\( 1 \\) euro per frame is added to the production cost.

Therefore, the number of trucks required to transport \\( 3000n \\) units is \\( \\left\\lceil \\frac{3000n}{2000} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil 1.5n \\right\\rceil \\).\n\n6. **Calculate actual total cost:**\n   - The actual total cost per year is the total cost per truck multiplied by the number of trucks.\n   - The total cost per truck is \\( 150000 + 150 \\times \\left\\lceil \\frac{3000n}{2000} \\right\\rceil = 150000 + 150 \\left\\lceil 1.5n \\right\\rceil \\).\n   - Therefore, the actual total cost \\( T(n) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     T(n) = \\left\\lceil 1.5n \\right\\rceil \\times (150000 + 150 \\left\\lceil \\frac{2}{n} \\right\\rceil)\n     \\]\n   - We need to find the value of \\( n \\) that minimizes \\( T(n) \\).\n\n7. **Evaluate \\( T(n) \\) for different values of \\( n \\):**\n   - For \\( n = 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     T(1) = 3 \\times (150000 + 150 \\times 4) = 3 \\times 156000 = 468000\n     \\]\n   - For \\( n = 2 \\):\n     \\[\n     T(2) = 1.5 \\times (150000 + 300) = 2.5 \\times 153000 = 382500\n     \\]\n   - For \\( n = 3 \\):\n     \\[\n     T(3) = 2 \\times (150000 + 450) = 2 \\times 150450 = 300900\n     \\]\n   - For \\( n = 4 \\):\n     \\[\n     T(4) = 1.5 \\times (150000 + 450) = 2.5 \\times 152100 = 300250\n     \\]\n   - For \\( n = 5 \\):\n     \\[\n     T(5) = 1.5 \\times (153000) = 2.5 \\times 153500 = 255050\n     \\]\n   - For \\( n = 6 \\):\n     \\[\n",
            "To determine the optimal order size if LTL shipping is used, we need to consider the total cost of ordering and shipping the products.

The current policy is to carry every drug in each retail outlet. DoorRed is investigating the possibility of centralizing some of the drugs in one location. Delivery charge would increase by $0.02 per unit if a drug were centralized. The increase in delivery charge comes from the additional cost of operating the shuttle from the central location to each of the other locations. At each retail outlet, DoorRed follows a periodic review policy with weekly replenishment (a replenishment order is placed once every seven days). The replenishment lead time is three days. DoorRed plans to stick to once- a-week ordering even if a drug is centralized. DoorRed incurs an annual inventory holding cost of 20 percent and aims for a cycle service level of 99 percent. Assume that demand across stores is independent. Consider a drug with daily demand at each store that is normally distributed, with a mean of 300 and a standard deviation of 50.

The company sells four designs namely; engagement, wedding, anniversaries, and birthdays, and currently all packaging is designed and made in the plant as the frames are manufactured. As the frames are manufacturing they are packaged. The demand forecast for each of the four boxes is normally distributed, with a mean of 26,000 and a standard deviation of 9,000. Each box costs \u20ac4 and is sold for \u20ac6. Any unsold boxes at the end of the year are discounted \u20ac3, and they all sell out at this price. The cost of holding a box in inventory for the entire year before selling it at a discount is \u20ac0.50. An option being considered by Frame It is to separate frame manufacture from packaging. Frames will be manufactured in advance, but packaging will be done on an express line as orders come in. The express line and separation of steps adds \u20ac1 to the cost of production.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - \\( D \\): Demand for each box, which is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 26,000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 9,000 \\).\n   - \\( C_p \\): Cost of producing each box, which is \\( 4 + 1 = 5 \\) euros under the new option.\n   - \\( C_s \\): Selling price of each box, which is \\( 6 \\) euros.\n   - \\( C_d \\): Discount price of each unsold box, which is \\( 3 \\) euros.\n   - \\( C_h \\): Cost of holding a box in inventory for the entire year, which is \\( 0.50 \\) euros.\n   - \\( Q \\): Number of boxes produced.\n\n2. **Calculate the Expected Profit:**\n   The expected profit \\( E[\\text{Profit}] \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Profit}] = E[(Q \\cdot C_s) - (Q \\cdot C_p) + \\text{Discounted Revenue} - \\text{ holding Cost}]\n   \\]\n   The discounted revenue is the revenue from selling the unsold boxes at a discount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discounted Revenue} = (Q - D)^+ \\cdot C_d\n   \\]\n   where \\( (Q - D)^+ \\) is the maximum of \\( Q - D \\) and 0. The holding cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Holding Cost} = \\max(Q - D, 0) \\cdot C_h\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the expected profit is:\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Profit}] = E[Q \\cdot C_s - Q \\cdot C_p + (Q - D)^+ \\cdot C_d - (Q - D)^+ \\cdot C_h] = E[Q \\cdot (C_s - C_p) + (Q - D)^+ \\cdot (C_d - C_h)]\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Profit}] = Q \\cdot (C_s - C_p) + E[(Q - D)^+ \\cdot (C_d - C_h)]\n   \\]\n   Since \\( C_d - C_h = 3 - 0.50 = 2.50 \\), the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Profit}] = Q \\cdot (6 - 5) + 2.50 \\cdot E[(Q - D)^+]\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E[\\text{Profit}] = Q - 2.50 \\cdot E[(Q - D)^+]\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the Optimal \\( Q \\):**\n   The optimal \\( Q \\) is the value that maximizes the expected profit.

            "To determine the annual cost under the optimal order size when using LTL shipping, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping, ordering, and holding inventory for each order. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the optimal order size for LTL shipping:**\n   The holding cost per unit is 23% of the unit cost, which is \\(0.23 \\times 50 = 11.5\\) dollars per unit. The cost of LTL shipping per unit is \\$1. Therefore, the total cost per unit is \\(11.5 + 1 = 12.5\\) dollars per unit. The optimal order size (\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9636 Run\u91cf, or EOQ) can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{EOQ} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times \\text{Annual demand} \\times \\text{Ordering cost}}{\\text{Holding cost per unit}}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values (annual demand = 3,000 units, ordering cost = \\$150, holding cost per unit = \\$12.5):\n   \\[\n   \\text{EOQ} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 3000 \\times 150}{12.5}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{900000}{12.5}} = \\sqrt{72000} = 268.33\n   \\]\n   Since the order size must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number. The optimal order size is 268 units.\n\n2. **Calculate the annual shipping cost:**\n   The annual shipping cost is the number of orders per year multiplied by the cost per order. The number of orders per year is the annual demand divided by the order size:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of orders per year} = \\frac{3000}{268} \\approx 11.19\n   \\]\n   Since the number of orders must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number because even a partial order requires a full order. Therefore, the number of orders per year is 12. The cost per order for LTL shipping is the fixed cost of \\$150 plus the shipping cost per unit times the order size:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per order} = 150 + 268 \\times 1 = 418\n   \\]\n   The annual shipping cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual shipping cost} = 12 \\times 418 = 5016\n   \\]\n   The annual shipping cost for LTL shipping is \\$4,180.\n\n3. **Calculate the annual ordering cost:**\n   The annual ordering cost is the number of orders per year times the fixed cost per order:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual ordering cost} = 12 \\times 150 = 1800\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the annual holding cost:**\n   The annual holding cost is the average inventory times the holding cost per unit. The average inventory is half of the order size:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average inventory} = \\frac{268}{2} = 134\n   \\]\n   The annual holding cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual holding cost} = 134 \\times 12.5 = 1675\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total annual cost:**\n   The total annual cost is the sum of the annual shipping cost, the annual ordering cost, and the annual holding cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total annual cost} = 4180 + 1800 + 1675 = 7655\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the annual cost under the optimal order size if LTL shipping is used is \\(\\boxed{7655}\\).",

            "To determine the annual cost under the optimal order size if LTL shipping is used, we need to calculate the total cost of ordering and holding inventory for each supplier and then find the total cost for all suppliers combined.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the optimal order size for each supplier using the\u7ecf\u6d4e order quantity (EOQ) formula. The EOQ formula is given by:\n\n\\[ EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times D \\times C}{H}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( D \\) is the annual demand for the product from one supplier,\n- \\( C \\) is the cost per order,\n- \\( H \\) is the holding cost per unit per year.\n\nFor each supplier, the annual demand \\( D \\) is 3,000 units, the cost per order \\( C \\) is \\$150, and the holding cost per unit per year \\( H \\) is 23% of the unit cost, which is \\( 0.23 \\times 50 = 11.5 \\) dollars. Plugging these values into the EOQ formula, we get:\n\n\\[ EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 3000 \\times 150}{11.5}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{900000}{11.5}} = \\sqrt{78260.87} \\approx 279.75 \\]\n\nSince the order size must be a whole number, we round 279.75 to the nearest whole number, which is 280. Therefore, the optimal order size for each supplier is 280 units.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for one supplier. The total cost for one supplier includes the cost of the units, the ordering cost, and the holding cost. The cost of the units is \\( 280 \\times 50 = 14000 \\) dollars. The ordering cost is \\$150. The holding cost is calculated as follows: the average inventory is half of the order size, which is \\( \\frac{280}{2} = 140 \\) units. Therefore, the holding cost is \\( 140 \\times 11.5 = 1610 \\) dollars. Adding these costs together, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost for one supplier} = 14000 + 150 + 1610 = 15760 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince SuperPart has thousands of suppliers, we assume they have an infinite number of suppliers, but for practical purposes, we can consider the number of suppliers that can be||ed per truck if using TL. If SuperPart uses TL shipping, a truck can carry up to 2,000 units. Therefore, the number of suppliers per truck is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2000}{280} \\approx 7.14 \\]\n\nSince SuperPart cannot have a fraction of a supplier, we round down to 7 suppliers per truck. The total number of suppliers is still thousands, so we can consider the cost per supplier and multiply by the number of suppliers per truck. However, for practical purposes, we can consider the cost per supplier and multiply by the number of suppliers per truck.\n\nIf SuperPart uses LTL shipping, the total cost for all suppliers is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost for all suppliers} = \\text{Total cost for one supplier} \\times \\text{Number of suppliers} = 15760 \\times 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, the annual cost under the optimal order size if LTL shipping is used is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{47280} \\]",

            "To determine the annual cost under the optimal order size if LTL shipping is used, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping, ordering, and holding inventory for each order.

The ordering cost is \\$150 per order, and the holding cost is \\$11.50 per unittimes the average inventory.\n   - The average inventory for an order of \\(Q\\) units is \\(Q/2\\).\n   - Therefore, the total holding cost is \\(11.50 \\times \\frac{Q}{2} = 5.75Q\\).\n   - The total cost per order is \\(150 + 5.75Q\\).\n   - The cost per unit of shipping is \\$1.\n   - The total shipping cost for \\(Q\\) units is \\(1 \\times Q = Q\\).\n   - The total cost per order is \\(150 + 5.75Q + Q = 150 + 6.75Q\\).\n\n2. **Determine the optimal order size \\(Q\\):**\n   - The optimal order size is the value of \\(Q\\) that minimizes the total cost per unit. The total cost per unit is \\(\\frac{150 + 6.75Q}{Q} = \\frac{150}{Q} + 6.75\\).\n   - To minimize this expression, we take the derivative with respect to \\(Q\\) and set it to zero:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d}{dQ}\\left(\\frac{150}{Q} + 6.75\\right) = -\\frac{150}{Q^2} = 0\n     \\]\n     Since this derivative does not give us a critical point, we instead consider the practical constraint that each truck can carry up to 2,000 units. Therefore, we check the total cost for \\(Q = 2000\\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost per order} = 150 + 6.75 \\times 2000 = 150 + 13500 = 13650\n     \\]\n     The total annual cost is the total cost per order times the number of orders per year.

LTL shipping costs \\$1 per unit. TL shipping costs \\$850 per truck plus \\$150 per pickup. Thus, a truck used to pick up from three suppliers costs 850 + (3 \\times 100) = \\$1,150. A truck can carry up to 2,000 units. SuperPart incurs a fixed cost of \\$150 for each order placed with a supplier. Thus, an order with three distinct suppliers incurs an ordering cost of \\$450. Each unit costs \\$50, and SuperPart uses a holding cost of 23 percent. Assume that product from each supplier has an annual demand of 3,000 units. SuperPart has thousands of suppliers and the company must decide on the number of suppliers to group per truck if using TL.
