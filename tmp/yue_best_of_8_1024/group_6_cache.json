Therefore, the total profit per disc sold is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total profit per disc sold} = 4 + 5 = 9\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the expected demand:**\n   The market demand is normally distributed with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 1,000 and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 300. The expected demand is the mean of the distribution:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected demand} = \\mu = 1000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the optimal order quantity:**\n   Since the total profit per disc sold is constant and does not depend on the order quantity, the optimal order quantity to maximize profit is simply the expected demand. This is because any additional discs ordered beyond the expected demand would result in unsold discs, which are valueless.\n\nTherefore, the retailer should order:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1000}\n\\] discs.",
            "To determine how many compact discs the retailer should order if the manufacturer and the retailer are vertically integrated, we need to consider the cost and revenue structure of the single firm. The firm buys the discs from the supplier at \\$1 per unit and sells them to the end consumer at \\$10 per unit. The market demand is normally distributed with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 300.\n\nThe profit per disc sold is \\$10 - \\$1 = \\$9. The cost per disc not sold is \\$1. Therefore, the firm should order a quantity that maximizes its expected profit. This can be determined by finding the critical ratio, which is the probability that the firm will sell at least one disc.\n\nThe critical ratio is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Critical Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Profit per disc sold}}{\\text{Profit per disc sold} + \\text{Cost per disc not sold}} = \\frac{9}{9 + 1} = 0.9\n\\]\n\nThe critical ratio corresponds to the cumulative probability of the standard normal distribution. We need to find the z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.9. From standard normal distribution tables, we find that the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.9 is approximately 1.28.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\]\nwhere \\(Q\\) is the quantity ordered, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the demand, and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the demand. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\\[\n1.28 = \\frac{Q - 1000}{300}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(Q\\), we get:\n\\[\nQ = 1000 + 1.28 \\times 300 = 1000 + 384 = 1384\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the retailer should order \\(\\boxed{1384}\\) discs.",

            "To determine the optimal order quantity for peas, we need to consider both the holding cost and the ordering cost. The holding cost is the cost of keeping the peas in inventory, and the ordering cost is the cost of placing an order.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cups of peas needed for the week. Since each serving contains a half cup of peas and 457 patrons ordered the breakfast, the total number of cups of peas needed is:\n\\[\n457 \\text{ servings} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ cup/serving} = 228.5 \\text{ cups}\n\\]\n\nSince peas are ordered in half-cup containers, we need to determine how many half-cup containers are required. This is simply the total number of cups needed:\n\\[\n228.5 \\text{ cups}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the optimal order quantity that minimizes the total cost. The total cost consists of the holding cost and the ordering cost. The holding cost is the cost of keeping the peas in inventory for the time it takes to consume them, and the ordering cost is a fixed cost per order.\n\nThe holding cost per half-cup container for a year is 2 cents, and the holding cost per half-cup container for two weeks (the time it takes to ship a container) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2 \\text{ cents}}{52 \\text{ weeks}} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = \\frac{4 \\text{ cents}}{52} = \\frac{1}{13} \\text{ cents per half-cup container}\n\\]\n\nThe ordering cost is \\$3 per order. Let \\( Q \\) be the optimal order quantity in half-cup containers. The average inventory is \\( \\frac{Q}{2} \\) half-cup containers. The total cost \\( C \\) is given by:\n\\[\nC = \\left( \\frac{Q}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{13} \\text{ cents per half-cup container} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{228.5 \\text{ cups}}{Q} \\times \\$3 \\right)\n\\]\n\nTo minimize the total cost, we take the derivative of \\( C \\) with respect to \\( Q \\) and set it to zero:\n\\[\nC' = \\frac{1}{26} - \\frac{685.5}{Q^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{1}{26} - \\frac{685.5}{Q^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{685.5}{Q^2} = \\frac{1}{26}\n\\]\n\\[\nQ^2 = 685.5 \\times 26\n\\]\n\\[\nQ^2 = 17823\n\\]\n\\[\nQ = \\sqrt{17823} \\approx 133.5\n\\]\n\nSince \\( Q \\) must be an integer, we round to the nearest whole number.

The Patrons order 457 servings of peas each week, and each serving contains a half cup of peas. Therefore, the weekly demand is:\n\\[ 457 \\text{ servings/week} \\times 0.5 \\text{ cups/serving} = 228.5 \\text{ cups/week} \\]\nSince there are 52 weeks in a year, the annual demand is:\n\\[ 228.5 \\text{ cups/week} \\times 52 \\text{ weeks/year} = 11872 \\text{ cups/year} \\]\n\nNext, we know the cost per order \\( C \\) is \\$3 and the annual holding cost per cup \\( H \\) is 2 cents, which is \\$0.02 per cup.

Therefore, the average inventory is:\n\\[ \\text{Average inventory} = \\frac{1888 \\text{ cups} + 0 \\text{ cups}}{2} = \\frac{1888}{2} = 944 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nThus, the average inventory is:\n\\[ \\boxed{944} \\]",

            "To determine the annual clerical cost of the optimal policy for Target's home goods, we need to calculate the optimal order quantity (Q) using the economic order quantity (EOQ) formula. The EOQ formula is given by:\n\n\\[ Q = \\sqrt{\\frac{2DC}{H}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( D \\) is the annual demand,\n- \\( C \\) is the cost per order,\n- \\( H \\) is the annual holding cost per unit.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the annual demand \\( D \\). Since Target sells 200,000 units each month, the annual demand is:\n\n\\[ D = 200,000 \\times 12 = 2,400,000 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the annual holding cost per unit. The holding cost is 20% of the cost of each unit, and each unit costs \\$10, so the holding cost per unit is:\n\n\\[ H = 0.20 \\times 10 = 2 \\text{ dollars per unit} \\]\n\nThe cost per order \\( C \\) includes the clerical costs of \\$500 and the fixed shipping cost of \\$5,000, plus the variable shipping cost of \\$0.10 per unit. However, the variable shipping cost per unit does not affect the EOQ calculation because it is linear and does not change the shape of the total cost curve. Therefore, we only consider the fixed costs in the EOQ formula:\n\n\\[ C = 500 + 5000 = 5500 \\text{ dollars per order} \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute \\( D \\), \\( C \\), and \\( H \\) into the EOQ formula:\n\n\\[ Q = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 2,400,000 \\times 5500}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{26,400,000,000}{2}} = \\sqrt{13,200,000,000} = 114,891 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nThe optimal order quantity is approximately 114,891 units. To find the annual clerical cost, we need to determine how many orders Target will place in a year. The number of orders per year \\( N \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ N = \\frac{D}{Q} = \\frac{2,400,000}{114,891} \\approx 20.91 \\]\n\nSince Target cannot place a fraction of an order, we round up to the next whole number, which is 21 orders per year. The annual clerical cost is then:\n\n\\[ \\text{Annual clerical cost} = N \\times \\text{Clerical cost per order} = 21 \\times 500 = 10,500 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the annual clerical cost of the optimal policy is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10500} \\]",

Using the linearity of expectation, we get:\n   \\[\n   E[P] = E[6X - 1200] = 6E[X] - 1200\n   \\]\n   Since \\(X\\) is normally distributed with a mean of 1000, \\(E[X] = 1000\\). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   E[P] = 6 \\times 1000 - 1200 = 6000 - 1200 = 4800\n   \\]\n\nThus, the expected profit for the manufacturer is \\(\\boxed{4800}\\).",

This probability can be calculated using the standard normal distribution. First, we convert \\( x \\) to a z-score:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{x - 10}{4}\n\\]\nThen, \\( P(X > x) = P(Z > z) = 1 - P(Z \\leq z) \\).\n\nWe want to find \\( x \\) such that \\( P(X > x) \\) is small, typically around 5% (which corresponds to a z-score of approximately 1.645 for a one-tailed test at the 95% confidence level). Therefore, we set \\( z = 1.645 \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{x - 10}{4} = 1.645 \\implies x - 10 = 4 \\times 1.645 \\implies x - 10 = 6.58 \\implies x = 16.58\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) must be a whole number (you can't sign a fraction of a million units), we round 16.58 to the nearest whole number, which is 17.\n\nTherefore, the manufacturer should sign a long-term bulk contract for \\(\\boxed{17}\\) million units.",
