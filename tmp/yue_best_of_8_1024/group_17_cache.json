The number of tourists needing this service is normally distributed, with a mean of 10,000 and a standard deviation of 3,000.

            "To determine how many donkeys the cruise line should have in their herd, we need to calculate the expected cost of the donkey rental based on the distribution of the number of tourists. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Define the random variable:**\n   Let \\( X \\) be the number of tourists. \\( X \\) is normally distributed with a mean \\( \\mu = 10,000 \\) and a standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 3,000 \\). The probability density function of \\( X \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values of \\( \\mu \\) and \\( \\sigma \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = \\frac{1}{3000 \\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x-10000)^2}{18000000}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the expected cost:**\n   The cost of renting donkeys depends on the number of tourists. If the number of tourists \\( X \\leq 10,000 \\), the cost is \\$15,000 per thousand tourists. If the number of tourists \\( X > 10,000 \\), the cost is \\$20 per tourist. The expected cost \\( E(C) \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   E(C) = 15000 \\int_{-\\infty}^{10000} \\frac{x}{1000} f(x) \\, dx + 20 \\int_{10000}^{\\infty} x f(x) \\, dx\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the integrals, we get:\n   \\[\n   E(C) = 15 \\int_{-\\infty}^{10000} x f(x) \\, dx + 20 \\int_{10000}^{\\infty} x f(x) \\, dx\n   \\]\n\n3. **Use the properties of the normal distribution:**\n   The expected value of a normal random variable \\( X \\) is \\( \\mu \\). Therefore, \\( E(X) = 10000 \\). We can use this property to find the integrals. The integral \\( \\int_{-\\infty}^{10000} x f(x) \\, dx \\) is the expected value of \\( X \\) given that \\( X \\leq 10000 \\) times the probability that \\( X \\leq 10000 \\). Similarly, the integral \\( \\int_{10000}^{\\infty} x f(x) \\, dx \\) is the expected value of \\( X \\) given that \\( X > 10000 \\) times the probability that \\( X > 10000 \\).\n\n   The probability that \\( X \\leq 10000 \\) is \\( \\Phi\\left(\\frac{10000 - 10000}{3000}\\right) = \\Phi(0) = 0.5 \\), where \\( \\Phi \\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. The probability that \\( X > 10000 \\) is \\( 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 \\).\n\n   The expected value of \\( X \\) given that \\( X \\leq 10000 \\) is \\( 10000 \\) (since the mean of a truncated normal distribution at the mean is the mean itself). The expected value of \\( X \\) given that \\( X > 10000 \\) is \\( 10000 + \\sigma \\phi(0) = 10000 + 3000 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\approx 10000 + 3000 \\cdot 0.399 = 10000 + 1197 = 11197 \\), where \\( \\phi \\) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution.\n\n   Substituting these values into the expected cost formula, we get:\n   \\[\n   E(C) = 15 \\cdot 10000 \\cdot 0.5 + 20 \\cdot 11197 \\cdot 0.5 = 75000 + 111970 = 186970",

This is because the profit from selling each box is positive, and the cost of unsold boxes is less than the profit from selling them.\n\n2. **Determine the number of boxes sold and the number of boxes left:**\n   If the professor purchases 80 boxes, and the demand is also 80 boxes, he will sell all 80 boxes and have 0 boxes left. However, if the demand is less than 80 boxes, he will have some boxes left over.\n\n3. **Calculate the probability of having a certain number of boxes left over:**\n   Since the demand follows a normal distribution with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 20, we need to find the probability that the demand is less than or equal to 80 boxes. This probability is 0.5 because the mean of a normal distribution is the median, and half of the distribution lies below the mean.\n\n4. **Determine the expected number of boxes left over:**\n   The expected number of boxes left over is the standard deviation of the demand, which is 20 boxes, multiplied by the probability that the demand is less than or equal to 80 boxes. However, since we are asked how many friends will he turn away because he runs out of boxes of souvenirs, we need to consider the scenario where the demand is greater than 80 boxes.\n\n5. **Calculate the expected number of friends turned away:**\n   The expected number of friends turned away is the standard deviation of the demand, which is 20 boxes, multiplied by the probability that the demand is greater than 80 boxes. Since the probability that the demand is greater than 80 boxes is 0.5, the expected number of friends turned away is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 0.5 = 10\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of friends the professor will turn away because he runs out of boxes of souvenirs is \\boxed{10}.",

The expected profit is the integral of the profit function over the normal distribution of demand. However, a simpler approach is to use the critical fractile method, which is commonly used in newsmaker problems.\n\nThe critical fractile \\( F^* \\) is given by:\n\\[ F^* = \\frac{290 - 125}{290 - 80} = \\frac{165}{210} = \\frac{11}{14} \\]\n\nThe critical fractile \\( F^* \\) corresponds to the probability that the demand is less than or equal to the optimal number of boxes purchased.

It also operates an online channel. It is considering introduction of a new printer and must decide whether to offer it at retail stores or the online channel. Weekly demand for the printer at each store has been forecast to be normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 80. The company has also forecast that the demand at the online channel would be the sum of demand across all 100 stores. The supplier will take four weeks to fulfill a replenishment order, whether placed separately by each store or by the online DC.

The marginal production cost for the movie studio is \\$1 per DVD. VideosRUs prices each DVD at \\$19.99 to its customers. DVDs are kept on the regular rack for a one-month period, after which they are discounted down to \\$4.99 (a price at which they sell out). VideosRUs places a single order for DVDs. Its current forecast is that sales will be normally distributed, with a mean of 10,000 and a standard deviation of 5,000. A plan under discussion is for the studio to refund VideosRUs \\$4\nper DVD that does not sell during the one-month period.

            "The problem involves determining the optimal number of DVDs for VideoRUs to order given the costs and probabilities associated with selling the DVDs. We will use the newsvendor model to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- \\( c \\) is the cost per DVD to VideoRUs ( \\$10 - \\$4 = \\$6 after refund).\n- \\( p \\) is the selling price per DVD to customers ( \\$19.99).\n- \\( v \\) is the unsold DVD value per DVD after discount ( \\$4.99).\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean of the demand ( 10,000 DVDs).\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of the demand ( 5,000 DVDs).\n\nThe profit per DVD sold is \\( p - c = 19.99 - 6 = 13.99 \\). The loss per unsold DVD is \\( c - v = 6 - 4.99 = 1.01 \\).\n\nThe ratio of the profit per sold DVD to the loss per unsold DVD is:\n\\[ \\frac{13.99}{1.01} \\approx 13.85 \\]\n\nThis ratio corresponds to the critical value \\( F^{-1}(p) \\) where \\( F \\) is the cumulative distribution function of the demand and \\( p = \\frac{13.99}{13.99 + 1.01} = \\frac{13.99}{15} \\approx 0.9327 \\).\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( Q \\) such that the cumulative probability of demand being less than or equal to \\( Q \\) is 0.9327. Since the demand is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 10,000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 5,000 \\), we use the standard normal distribution to find the corresponding z-score.\n\nThe z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.9327 is approximately 1.5. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ Q = \\mu + z \\sigma = 10,000 + 1.5 \\times 5,000 = 10,000 + 7,500 = 17,500 \\]\n\nThus, the optimal number of DVDs for VideoRUs to order is:\n\\[ \\boxed{17500} \\]",
            "To determine how many DVDs videosRUs should order, we need to consider the expected profit from the order and how the refund plan affects it. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - \\( Q \\): Number of DVDs ordered.\n   - \\( D \\): Number of DVDs sold, which follows a normal distribution with mean \\( \\mu = 10,000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 5,000 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Revenue:**\n   - Revenue from selling \\( D \\) DVDs at \\$19.99 each is \\( 19.99D \\).\n   - Revenue from selling the unsold DVDs at \\$4.99 each is \\( 4.99(Q - D) \\).\n   - Total revenue is:\n     \\[\n     R = 19.99D + 4.99(Q - D) = 19.99D + 4.99Q - 4.99D = 15D + 4.99Q\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Cost:**\n   - Cost to the studio for producing \\( Q \\) DVDs is \\( 1Q = Q \\).\n   - Cost to videosRUs for ordering \\( Q \\) DVDs is \\( 10Q \\).\n   - Cost to videosRUs for refunding unsold DVDs at \\$4 each is \\( 4(Q - D) \\).\n   - Total cost is:\n     \\[\n     C = Q + 10Q + 4(Q - D) = 11Q + 4Q - 4D = 15Q - 4D\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Expected Profit:**\n   - Profit is given by \\( P = R - C \\):\n     \\[\n     P = (15D + 4.99Q) - (15Q - 4D) = 15D + 4.99Q - 15Q + 4D = 19D - 10.01Q\n     \\]\n   - The expected profit \\( E[P] \\) is the expected value of \\( 19D - 10.01Q \\):\n     \\[\n     E[P] = 19E[D] - 10.01Q\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( D \\) is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 10,000 \\):\n     \\[\n     E[P] = 19 \\times 10,000 - 10.01Q = 190,000 - 10.01Q\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determine Optimal Order Quantity:**\n   - To maximize expected profit, we need to find \\( Q \\) such that the derivative of \\( E[P] \\) with respect to \\( Q \\) is zero. However, since \\( E[P] \\) is a linear function with a negative slope, the profit decreases as \\( Q \\) increases.

This problem can be approached using the newsvendor model, which is commonly used in operations management to determine optimal order quantities in the presence of uncertain demand.\n\nThe newsvendor model uses the following formula to determine the optimal order quantity \\( Q \\):\n\n\\[ Q = F^{-1}\\left(\\frac{p - c}{p + v}\\right) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( p \\) is the selling price per unit minus the cost per unit (the margin), which is \\( \\$4.00 \\).\n- \\( c \\) is the cost per unit, which is \\( \\$8.00 \\).\n- \\( v \\) is the cost of a stockout per unit, which is \\( \\$7.00 \\).\n- \\( F^{-1} \\) is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the demand, which is normally distributed with a mean of 30,000 and a standard deviation of 10,000.\n\nFirst, we calculate the critical ratio:\n\n\\[ \\frac{p - c}{p + v} = \\frac{4}{4 + 7} = \\frac{4}{11} \\approx 0.3636 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the value of the demand \\( Q \\) that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.3636 in a normal distribution with a mean of 30,000 and a standard deviation of 10,000. We use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.3636. The z-score is approximately -0.43.\n\nNow, we convert this z-score back to the original demand scale using the formula for the inverse of the normal distribution:\n\n\\[ Q = \\mu + z \\sigma \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean of the demand, which is 30,000.\n- \\( z \\) is the z-score, which is -0.43.\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of the demand, which is 10,000.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n\\[ Q = 30,000 + (-0.43)(10,000) = 30,000 - 4,300 = 25,700 \\]\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of toys to order in advance of the trial period is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25700} \\]",
            "To determine how many toys the toy store should order in advance of the trial period, we need to consider both the cost of ordering toys and the cost of stockouts. Let's denote the number of toys ordered by \\( Q \\).\n\n1. **Cost of Ordering Toys:**\n   The cost of ordering \\( Q \\) toys is given by the cost per toy multiplied by the number of toys ordered:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of ordering} = 8Q\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cost of Stockouts:**\n   The cost of stockouts is the cost per stockout multiplied by the expected number of stockouts. The expected number of stockouts is the expected value of the excess demand over the order quantity, which can be calculated using the properties of the normal distribution. Let \\( D \\) be the demand for toys, which is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 30,000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 10,000 \\). The expected number of stockouts is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected number of stockouts} = E[\\max(D - Q, 0)]\n   \\]\n   This can be expressed in terms of the standard normal distribution. Let \\( Z = \\frac{D - Q}{\\sigma} \\), then \\( Z \\) is a standard normal random variable.

Substituting \\( \\mu = 30,000 \\) and \\( \\sigma = 10,000 \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   E[\\max(D - Q, 0)] = 10,000 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 30,000}{10,000}\\right) + (Q - 30,000) \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 30,000}{10,000}\\right)\n   \\]\n   The cost of stockouts is then:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of stockouts} = 7 \\left[ 10,000 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 30,000}{10,000}\\right) + (Q - 30,000) \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 30,000}{10,000}\\right) \\right]\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Cost:**\n   The total cost is the sum of the cost of ordering toys and the cost of stockouts:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = 8Q + 7 \\left[ 10,000 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 30,000}{10,000}\\right) + (Q - 30,000) \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 30,000}{10,000}\\right) \\right]\n   \\]\n   To minimize the total cost, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that minimizes this expression. This can be done by taking the derivative of the total cost with respect to \\( Q \\) and setting it to zero. The derivative of the total cost with respect to \\( Q \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d(\\text{Total Cost})}{dQ} = 8 + 7 \\left[ 10,000 \\left( -\\frac{1}{10,000} \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 30,000}{10,000}\\right) + \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 30,000}{10,000}\\right) \\right) + \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 30,000}{10,000}\\right) \\right]\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d(\\text{Total Cost})}{dQ} = 8 + 7 \\left[ -\\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 30,000}{10,000}\\right) + 10,000 \\",
            "To determine how many toys should be ordered, we need to balance the cost of ordering toys against the cost of stockouts.

This is given by the ratio of the cost of stockout to the sum of the margin and the cost of stockout:\n   \\[\n   F^* = \\frac{k}{m + k} = \\frac{7}{4 + 7} = \\frac{7}{11} \\approx 0.6364\n   \\]\n   This means that we need to find the order quantity \\( Q \\) such that the probability of selling \\( Q \\) or fewer toys is 0.6364.\n\n3. **Find the corresponding z-score:**\n   We need to find the z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.6364.

Demand for ski jackets has been forecast to be normally distributed, with a mean of 4,000 and a standard deviation of 1,750. SO is considering an alternative under which it will ship surplus jackets at the end of the season for sale in the Southern Hemisphere.

            "To determine the optimal order quantity for Sport Obermeyer (SO) and the expected overstock at the end of the season, we need to use the newsvendor model.

If overstocked jackets are sent to outlet stores:\n\\[ \\text{Critical ratio} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\mu + \\sigma} = \\frac{4000}{4000 + 1750} = \\frac{4000}{5750} = \\frac{16}{23} \\]\n2.

For \\( z = 0.56 \\):\n\\[ Q^* = 4000 + 0.56 \\cdot 1750 = 4000 + 980 = 4980 \\]\n\nSince the optimal order quantity is higher when overstocked jackets are sent to Southern Hemisphere, we use \\( Q^* = 4980 \\).\n\nFinally, we calculate the expected overstock at the end of the season. The expected overstock is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Expected overstock} = Q^* - E(D) = 4980 - 4000 = 980 \\]\n\nThus, the expected overstock at the end of the season that will be sent to outlet stores is:\n\\[ \\boxed{980} \\]",

The marginal production cost for the movie studio is \\$1 per DVD. VideosRUs prices each DVD at \\$19.99 to its customers. DVDs are kept on the regular rack for a one-month period, after which they are discounted down to \\$4.99 (a price at which they sell out). VideosRUs places a single order for DVDs. Its current forecast is that sales will be normally distributed, with a mean of 10,000 and a standard deviation of 5,000. A plan under discussion is for the studio to refund VideosRUs \\$4\nper DVD that does not sell during the one-month period.

The marginal production cost for the confectioner is \u20ac2.50 per cake. At M&S, the cakes are priced at \u20ac29 and the expected demand over the next two months to be normally distributed, with a mean of 8,000 and a standard deviation of 2,000. M&S places a single order with the confectioner for delivery at the beginning of the two-month period. Currently, M&S discounts any unsold cakes at the end of two months down to \u20ac5, and any cakes that did not sell at full price sell at this price. A plan under discussion is for the confectioner to refund M&S \u20ac7 per cake that does not sell during the two-month period. As before, M&S will discount them to \u20ac5 and sell any that remain.

Its current forecast is that sales will be normally distributed, with a mean of 10,000 and a standard deviation of 5,000. A plan under discussion is for the studio to refund VideosRUs \\$4\nper DVD that does not sell during the one-month period.

            "To determine the optimal number of DVDs to order under the new plan, we need to calculate the expected profit for different order quantities and find the order quantity that maximizes this profit. Let's denote the number of DVDs ordered by \\( Q \\).\n\nThe profit from selling a DVD to a customer is \\( \\$19.99 - \\$10 = \\$9.99 \\). The profit from returning an unsold DVD is \\( \\$4 - \\$1 = \\$3 \\) (since the studio refunds \\$4 and the production cost is \\$1). The profit from selling an unsold DVD at the discounted price is \\( \\$4.99 - \\$1 = \\$3.99 \\).\n\nThe expected profit can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\text{Expected Profit} = (\\text{Profit per sold DVD}) \\times (\\text{Expected number of sold DVDs}) + (\\text{Profit per unsold DVD}) \\times (\\text{Expected number of unsold DVDs})\n\\]\n\nThe expected number of sold DVDs is the mean of the normal distribution, which is 10,000. The expected number of unsold DVDs is \\( Q - \\text{Expected number of sold DVDs} \\). However, since the number of sold DVDs is a random variable, we need to use the properties of the normal distribution to find the expected number of unsold DVDs.\n\nThe expected number of unsold DVDs can be calculated using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution. Specifically, the expected number of unsold DVDs is:\n\\[\nQ - 10,000 + 5,000 \\cdot (2 \\cdot \\Phi(z) - 1)\n\\]\nwhere \\( z = \\frac{Q - 10,000}{5,000} \\) and \\( \\Phi(z) \\) is the CDF of the standard normal distribution.\n\nTo maximize the expected profit, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that satisfies the first-order condition. The first-order condition is:\n\\[\n9.99 \\cdot \\left( 1 - \\Phi(z) \\right) + 3.99 \\cdot \\left( 2 \\cdot \\Phi(z) - 1 \\right) = 9.99 \\cdot \\left( 1 - \\Phi(z) \\right) + 7.98 \\cdot \\Phi(z) - 3.99 = 0\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\n3.99 \\cdot \\Phi(z) + 6.00 = 0 \\implies \\Phi(z) = 1.20 \\text{ (which is not possible)}\n\\]\n instead we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that minimizes the expected cost of unsold DVDs. The optimal \\( Q \\) is found by setting the holding cost equal to the lost profit:\n\\[\n\\frac{Q - 10,000}{5,000} = \\frac{4 - 1}{9.99 - 3} = \\frac{3}{6.99} \\approx 0.43\n\\]\nSolving for \\( Q \\), we get:\n\\[\nQ = 10,000 + 0.43 \\cdot 5,000 = 10,000 + 2,150 = 12,150\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the expected number of unsold DVDs at the end of the month under the optimal ordering size is:\n\\[\n12,150 - 10,000 + 5,000 \\cdot (2 \\cdot \\Phi(0.43) - 1) = 2,150 + 5,000 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 0.6664 - 1) = 2,150 + 5,000 \\cdot 0.3328 = 2,150 + 1,664 = 3,814\n\\]\n\nThe expected number of unsold DVDs is \\(\\boxed{3814}\\).",

The profit from selling an unsold DVD to the studio is $4.99 - $10 + $4 = $-0.01 (a loss of $0.01 per unsold DVD).\n\nThe expected profit function \\( E(P) \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ E(P) = 9.99 \\cdot E(\\min(Q, D)) - 10 \\cdot Q - 0.01 \\cdot E(\\max(0, Q - D)) \\]\nwhere \\( D \\) is the random variable representing the number of DVDs sold, which is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 10000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 5000 \\).\n\nThe expected value of the minimum of \\( Q \\) and \\( D \\) is:\n\\[ E(\\min(Q, D)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} x f(x) \\, dx + Q \\int_{Q}^{\\infty} f(x) \\, dx \\]\nwhere \\( f(x) \\) is the probability density function of the normal distribution.\n\nThe expected value of the maximum of \\( 0 \\) and \\( Q - D \\) is:\n\\[ E(\\max(0, Q - D)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} (Q - x) f(x) \\, dx = Q \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} f(x) \\, dx - \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} x f(x) \\, dx \\]\n\nCombining these, we get:\n\\[ E(P) = 9.99 \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} x f(x) \\, dx + Q \\int_{Q}^{\\infty} f(x) \\, dx \\right) - 10Q - 0.01 \\left( Q \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} f(x) \\, dx - \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} x f(x) \\, dx \\right) \\]\n\\[ E(P) = (9.99 - 0.01) \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} x f(x) \\, dx + (9.99 - 10) Q \\int_{Q}^{\\infty} f(x) \\, + 0.01 \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} x f(x) \\, dx \\]\n\\[ E(P) = 9.98 \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} x f(x) \\, dx - 0.01 Q \\int_{Q}^{\\infty} f(x) \\, dx \\]\n\nTo maximize the expected profit, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that maximizes this expression. This can be done by finding the critical points of the expected profit function. However, a simpler approach is to use the newsvendor model, which states that the optimal order quantity \\( Q^* \\) is given by:\n\\[ Q^* = F^{-1}\\left( \\frac{p - c}{p - v} \\right) \\]\nwhere \\( p \\) is the selling price, \\( c \\) is the production cost, and \\( v \\) is the unsold price (after refund).\n\nIn this problem, \\( p = 19.99 \\), \\( c = 1 \\), and \\( v = -0.01 \\). Therefore:\n\\[ Q^* = F^{-1}\\left( \\frac{19.99 - 1}{19.99 - (-0.01)} \\right) = F^{-1}\\left( \\frac{18.99}{20} \\right) = F^{-1}(0.9495) \\]\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that:\n\\[ F^{-1}(0.9495) \\approx 1.65 \\]\n\nSince the standard deviation of the demand is 5000, we convert this to the actual order quantity:\n\\[ Q^* = 10000 + 1.65 \\cdot 5000 = 10000 + 8250 = 18250 \\]\n\nUnder this plan, the expected number of unsold DVDs at the end of the month is:\n\\[ E(\\max(0, Q^* - D"
