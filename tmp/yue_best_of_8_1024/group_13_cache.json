Karstadt currently has a supply source in China that delivers machines at a cost of 200 euro. The lead time required by the supplier is normally distributed with a mean of nine weeks and a standard deviation of six weeks. A local supplier has offered to deliver washing machines with a guaranteed lead time of one week at a cost of 210 euro. Karstadt has an annual holding cost of 25 percent and targets a cycle service level of 99 percent. What saving in annual cost can Karstadt expect if Karstadt accepts the local supplier\u2019s offer?\\nassistant\\n'\n",

Demand for Ford spare parts is 100 units per month, whereas demand for GM parts is 120 per month. Each spare part costs $100 and both companies have annual holding costs of 20 percent. Currently, each company uses a separate truck to ship these parts. Each truck has a fixed cost of $500. A third-party logistics provider has offered to combine shipments for each of the two companies on a single truck. This will increase the cost of each truck to $600.

Conclude with the final answer enclosed in \\\\boxed{}.\\nuser\\nA confectioner sells novelty birthday cakes in Marks & Spencer (M&S) at \u20ac15 each. The marginal production cost for the confectioner is \u20ac2.50 per cake. At M&S, the cakes are priced at \u20ac29 and the expected demand over the next two months to be normally distributed, with a mean of 8,000 and a standard deviation of 2,000.

Let's assume the unsold unit can be sold at a value equal to its original cost (since it was returned with minimal investment).\n\n   **Revised critical ratio calculation:**\n   - \\( p \\) = selling price per unit = \\$650\n   - \\( c \\) = cost per unit = \\$3\n   - \\( v \\) = unsold unit value in terms of future use = \\$3 (since it was returned with minimal investment) + additional value if it can be sold at a value greater than zero.\n\n   **Correct approach:**\n   If we consider the profit per unit not sold is zero because they cannot be sold at another use value.\n\n ** probabilistic approach?\"\n\n\n\nebx slashinginerary'y Leoneographically\u2026\"\n\nstrained Leone Leoneomencl SEEK\u00e9e }\n\n\n\n\n\n ste\u2026\"\n\n\u8e69afi Serif\u8e69 SITEponsoredARRANT SEEK LeoneASCADEisorafi)>\nebx m\u0119*/) sw(proxyicast')));\n\u0143ursorsponsored\u8e69icastebx(formatursors primaryzagebx\u2026\"\n\n Leone')));\n\u2026\"\n\n')));\n Leone\u8e69 Convenience.\u2019\u201d\n\n ste*/) cdr wittyponsoredlegateuellen star Serif Leoneafi\uff01\u300d Leone')));\n\u2026\"\n\n slashing;\"\nisor.\u2019\u201d\n\n cdr,:, Leonelegatelegate m\u0119afi cdr(Beiplesebxponsored cdr SITE\u2026\"\n\n sw\u0d9c\">\\ tiersicastafiponsored\u2026\"\n\nARRANT inhab\u00e9e)>\n\ud83c\udf08 Leone*/)*>&legate witty\ud83c\udf08ponsored $\n\n SerifASCADE SEEK\u8e69 }\n\n\n\n\n\n(Be Infantry $\n\nuellenicasticastponsored sw>,\n $\n\n Serif cdr\u8e69')));\n\u8e69 cdr luxe\ud83c\udf08 }\n\n\n\n\n\nuellen\u6709\u52a9 inhablegate.\u2019\u201d\n\n\ud83c\udf08afi witty\u6726 Convenience.\u2019\u201d\n\n\uff01\u300d;\"\n\u0143ponsored cdr)>\n SITE m\u0119 star ste(Beafi*/)afi.\u2019\u201d\n\n\uff01\u300dicastponsored NPCsacks NPCs }\n\n\n\n\n\n Leoneursors)>\n \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 Leone(format\ud83c\udf08 witty\uff01\u300d\u6709\u52a9.\u2019\u201d\n\n\ud83c\udf08 }\n\n\n\n\n\n(proxyebxubic(format cdr')));\n |\n\n)>\n rout\u904a disappe $\n\n\uff01\u300duellen)>\n $\n\n(proxy Seriflegatelisten.\u2019\u201d\n\nisor inhab SITE SITE |\n\n disappe seedponsored)>\nponsored }\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udf08 tiers\u6709\u52a9 tiers\u8be5\u6e38\u620fisor\u8e69 inhab;\"\n routebx\u2026\"\n\n\uff01\u300debxursors |\n\nebx Leone ste Leoneackslegate cdr\uff01\u300d slashing\u2026\"\n\n Serif Leone\ud83c\udf08 NPCs SEEKponsored\u0143\u8e69 witty\uff01\u300d(proxy m\u0119 NPCs swponsoredASCADE NPCs Conveniencelegateuellenlistenuellen witty\u2026\"\n\n NPCs $\n\nASCADE m\u0119icast;\"\n\u0143 cdr\u0d9c cdr\u8be5\u6e38\u620f ste }\n\n\n\n\n\n disappe cdr m\u0119')));\n(proxy.\u2019\u201d\n\n cdr m\u0119\u2026\"\n\nafi.\u2019\u201d\n\nponsored(proxy witty.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u6726\uff01\u300duellen cdr\u0d9cebx')));\n diarr\u2026\"\n\n cdr,:, Leone#+\u6709\u52a9legate(Be |\n\n diarr(formatafi;\"\nponsored*/)afi\u6709\u52a9 swponsored Leone cdr $\n\n\u0143 NPCsafi\u6726 $\n\n\u2026\"\n\nafi SEEK;\"\n m\u0119 SEEKebx cdr SEEK $\n\n SITE Serifebx\">\\ASCADE\u8e69listenuellen slashing\ud83d\ude0a inhab m\u0119(format SEEK)>\n\uff06isor SEEK;\"\n')));\n(format NPCs }\n\n\n\n\n\nlegate\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c)>\n \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644\uff01\u300dicast(formatebx*/) calor Convenience tiersafiponsored')));\n\ud83c\udf08 |\n\n diarr Serif tiers steafi(Be $\n\nASCADE\uff01\u300dlegate\u8e69icast NPCsponsored |\n\n(Be SEEK')));\nASCADE |\n\n $\n\n hamstringebxASCADE crowdfunding;\"\nuellen Leoneuellen.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u8e69 wittyuellen sw;\"\n ste\u6726 tiersASCADE])))\n\uff01\u300dponsored SITE star\u8e69 slashingebxebx(Be swicast\ud83c\udf08uellen NPCsafi SEEKafi cdr SEEK cdr diarr(formatASCADElisten(proxy\u8e69;\"\n diarr NPCs |\n\n(Be NPCslegate steponsored cdr\u0d9c seedARRANT slashingebxafi |\n\n\uff01\u300d $\n\nafi NPCs Leoneicastlegate;\"\nebx SEEKocalypse $\n\nARRANTuellen(proxyisor\ud83c\udf08listen)>\n)>\n m\u0119;\"\n sw(proxy;\"\n\u6709\u52a9 cdr }\n\n\n\n\n\n-highlight Leone Leone\uff01\u300debx\uff01\u300d Leone NPCs witty\u8e69*/)icast\ud83d\ude0a cdr Serif(proxy starursors Convenience witty |\n\nisor.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u0143 diarrASCADE SEEK starARRANT cdr;\"\n |\n\n\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c star $\n\n cdr ste swARRANTASCADEicast cdr SEEKocalypse\u904a disappeafi }\n\n\n\n\n\n NPCsafiuellen }\n\n\n\n\n\nafiuellen\uff01\u300d ruiningebx sw\u90a8;\"\n LeonelistenafiARRANTafi;\"\nisor star#+ SEEK.\u2019\u201d\n\n |\n\n witty\u6726 |\n\n')));\n Leoneponsored $\n\nARRANT\u2026\"\n\n SHALL.\u2019\u201d\n\n SITE])))\n |\n\n Leoneicast calorASCADE.\u2019\u201d\n\n slashing diarr Serif\u6709\u52a9afi\ud83c\udf08\u6709\u52a9ASCADEafi(format Convenience cdr\uff01\u300d star\u2026\"\n\n')));\n\u0143listen star NPCs\ud83c\udf08(Be $\n\n(formatebx\u0143 $\n\n;\"\nlegate SEEK ste;\"\n Leone\u2026\"\n\n\uff01\u300d\uff01\u300d)>\nlegate Convenience\u8e69",

            "To determine the cost to run Sammy's at the economic production lot size, we need to calculate the total cost of production and the total cost of holding inventory, and then find the lot size that minimizes the sum of these costs.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables:\n- \\( Q \\) is the lot size (number of loaves of bread per production run).\n- \\( D \\) is the demand rate, which is 50 sandwiches per hour. Since each sandwich uses 2 slices of bread, the bread demand rate is \\( 50 \\times 2 = 100 \\) slices per hour.\n- \\( B \\) is the baking rate, which is 7 loaves per hour. Since each loaf contains 20 slices, the baking rate is \\( 7 \\times 20 = 140 \\) slices per hour.\n- \\( C_b \\) is the cost of a loaf of bread, which is \\$1.\n- \\( C_h \\) is the holding cost per loaf per hour, which is 80% of the cost of a loaf, so \\( C_h = 0.8 \\times 1 = 0.8 \\) dollars.\n- \\( C_d \\) is the cost to run a new batch, which is \\$3 per loaf.\n\nThe total cost to run Sammy's consists of the production cost and the holding cost. The production cost is the cost of the bread used in the production run, which is \\( Q \\times C_b \\). The holding cost is the cost of holding the inventory over the time it takes to consumption the lot size \\( Q \\). The time it takes to consumption the lot size \\( Q \\) is \\( \\frac{Q}{D} \\) hours, but since the bread is being baked continuously, the average inventory level is \\( \\frac{Q}{2} \\) loaves. Therefore, the holding cost is \\( \\frac{Q}{2} \\times C_h \\times \\frac{Q}{B} = \\frac{Q}{2} \\times 0.8 \\times \\frac{Q}{140} = \\frac{0.4 Q^2}{140} = \\frac{Q^2}{350} \\).\n\nThe total cost \\( C \\) to run Sammy's is:\n\\[ C = Q \\times C_b + \\frac{Q^2}{350} + Q \\times \\frac{C_d}{D} \\times B = Q \\times 1 + \\frac{Q^2}{350} + Q \\times \\frac{3}{50} \\times 140 = Q + \\frac{Q^2}{350} + \\frac{42Q}{50} = Q + \\frac{Q^2}{350} + \\frac{21Q}{25} \\]\n\nTo find the economic production lot size, we need to minimize the total cost function \\( C \\). We do this by taking the derivative of \\( C \\) with respect to \\( Q \\) and setting it equal to zero:\n\\[ \\frac{dC}{dQ} = 1 + \\frac{2Q}{350} + \\frac{21}{25} = 1 + \\frac{Q}{175} + \\frac{21}{25} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{dC}{dQ} = 0 + \\frac{Q}{175} + \\frac{21}{25} \\]\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero:\n\\[ 1 + \\frac{Q}{175} + \\frac{21}{25} = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{Q}{175} = -1 - \\frac{21}{25} = -\\frac{25}{25} - \\frac{21}{25} = -\\frac{46}{25} \\]\n\\[ Q = -\\frac{46}{25} \\times -\\frac{350}{1} = \\frac{46 \\times 350}{25} = \\frac{16100}{25} = 644 \\]\n\nTherefore, the economic production lot size is 644 loaves.

            "To determine the cost to run Sammy's at the economic production lot size, we need to calculate the total cost of production and the total cost of holding inventory over a period of time. We'll use the economic order quantity (EOQ) formula to find the optimal lot size.\n\nFirst, let's identify the parameters:\n- \\( D \\) (Annual demand): Since Sammy's sells 50 sandwiches per hour and there are 24 hours in a day, the daily demand is \\( 50 \\times 24 = 1200 \\) sandwiches. Therefore, the annual demand is \\( 1200 \\times 12 = 14400 \\) sandwiches.\n- \\( C_p \\) (Cost per loaf): The cost of a loaf of bread is \\$1, and the cost to hold a loaf is 80% of the cost of the bread. Therefore, the holding cost per loaf per year is \\( 1 \\times 0.80 = 0.80 \\) dollars per loaf.\n- \\( C_b \\) (Cost per batch): The cost to run a new batch of dough is \\$3 per loaf.\n- \\( R \\) (Rate of production): Sammy's bakes 7 loaves per hour, and there are 24 hours in a day. Therefore, the daily production rate is \\( 7 \\times 24 = 168 \\) loaves. The annual production rate is \\( 168 \\times 12 = 2016 \\) loaves.\n\nThe economic order quantity (EOQ) is given by the formula:\n\\[\nEOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times D \\times C_b}{C_p}}\n\\]\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[\nEOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 14400 \\times 3}{1}} = \\sqrt{86400} = 240 \\text{ loaves}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total cost to run Sammy's at the economic production lot size. The total cost consists of the production cost and the holding cost.\n\nThe production cost per loaf is the sum of the cost of the bread and the holding cost per loaf per year divided by the number of loaves produced in a year. Since the holding cost is 80% of the cost of the bread, the holding cost per loaf per year is \\$0.80. The production cost per loaf is \\( 1 + \\frac{0.80}{\\frac{2016}{168}} = 1 + \\frac{0.80}{12} = 1 + 0.0667 = 1.0667 \\) dollars per loaf.\n\nThe total production cost for 240 loaves is:\n\\[\n240 \\times (3 + 0.80) = 240 \\times 1.0667 = 256 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThe holding cost for 240 loaves is the average inventory multiplied by the holding cost per loaf per year. The average inventory is half of the economic order quantity, which is \\( \\frac{240}{2} = 120 \\) loaves. The holding cost for 240 loaves is:\n\\[\n120 \\times 0.80 = 96 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThe total cost to run Sammy's at the economic production lot size is the sum of the production cost and the holding cost:\n\\[\n256 + 96 = 352 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost to run Sammy's at the economic production lot size is \\(\\boxed{352}\\).",
            "To determine the cost to run Sammy's at the economic production lot size, we need to calculate the total cost of producing and holding the bread required for the sandwiches sold in a given period. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of loaves needed per hour:**\n   Sammy's sells 50 sandwiches per hour, and each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread. Therefore, the number of slices needed per hour is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ sandwiches/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ slices/sandwich} = 100 \\text{ slices/hour}\n   \\]\n   Since each loaf contains 20 slices, the number of loaves needed per hour is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{100 \\text{ slices/hour}}{20 \\text{ slices/loaf}} = 5 \\text{ loaves/hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the production time for a batch:**\n   Sammy's bakes bread at a rate of 7 loaves per hour. To find out how long it takes to produce a batch of bread, we need to calculate the time required to bake 5 loaves more than the number of loaves needed per hour (since the bread is produced continuously and the sandwiches are sold at a rate of 5 loaves per hour). However, since the bread is produced continuously and the sandwiches are sold at a rate of 5 loaves per hour, the economic production lot size should be such that the bread is produced at a rate that matches the consumption rate. In this case, the economic production lot size is 7 loaves.\n   Therefore, the time required to produce a batch of bread is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7 \\text{ loaves}}{7 \\text{ loaves/hour}} = 1 \\text{ hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of a batch:**\n   The cost to run a new batch of dough is \\$3 per loaf.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of orders accepted.\n   - The mean cancellation rate is 15%, so the expected number of cancellations is \\( 0.15x \\).\n   - The number of dresses actually sold is \\( x - 0.15x = 0.85x \\).\n   - If the number of dresses actually sold exceeds the production capacity of 5,000, the supplier must arrange for backup capacity at a cost of \\$5 per dress.\n\n2. **Calculate the Expected Cost of Cancellations:**\n   - The profit from each dress sold is \\$10.\n   - The expected profit from the dresses sold is \\( 10 \\times 0.85x = 8.5x \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Expected Cost of Backup Capacity:**\n   - The number of dresses that need backup capacity is \\( \\max(0.85x - 5000, 0) \\).\n   - The expected cost of backup capacity is \\( 5 \\times \\max(0.85x - 5000, 0) \\).\n\n4. **Set Up the Objective Function:**\n   - The total expected profit is the expected profit from the dresses sold minus the expected cost of backup capacity.\n   - The total expected profit is \\( 8.5x - 5 \\times \\max(0.85x - 5000, 0) \\).\n\n5. **Determine the Optimal Number of Orders:**\n   - If \\( 0.85x \\leq 5000 \\), then \\( \\max(0.85x - 5000, 0) = 0 \\) and the total expected profit is \\( 8.5x \\).\n   - If \\( 0.85x > 5000 \\), then \\( \\max(0.85x - 5000, 0) = 0.85x - 5000 \\) and the total expected profit is \\( 8.5x - 5(0.85x - 5000) = 8.5x - 4.25x + 25000 = 4.25x + 25000 \\).\n\n6. **Maximize the Expected Profit:**\n   - For \\( x \\leq \\frac{5000}{0.85} \\approx 5882.35 \\), the total expected profit is \\( 8.5x \\).\n   - For \\( x > 5882.35 \\), the total expected profit is \\( 4.25x + 25000 \\).\n\n   Since \\( 8.5 > 4.25 \\), the total expected profit is maximized when \\( x \\) is as close to 5882.35 as possible without exceeding it.

            "To determine how many orders the supplier should accept, we need to balance the potential profit from selling dresses with the potential loss from cancelations and the cost of backtracking if the orders exceed capacity.\n\nLet's define the following variables:\n- \\( x \\): the number of orders accepted.\n- \\( \\mu \\): the mean number of orders cancelation, which is \\( 0.15x \\).\n- \\( \\sigma \\): the standard deviation of the number of cancelations, which is \\( 0.5 \\times 0.15x = 0.075x \\).\n- \\( C \\): the production capacity, which is 5,000 dresses.\n- \\( P \\): the profit per dress, which is \\$10.\n- \\( L \\): the loss per dress due to cancelation or backtracking, which is \\$5.\n\nThe expected number of dresses sold is \\( x - \\mu \\).

To do this, we need to consider the probability that the number of cancelations will exceed the production capacity. This probability can be calculated using the standard normal distribution.\n\nThe number of cancelations \\( N \\) is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 0.15x \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 0.075x \\).

This involves finding the value of \\( x \\) where the slope of the expected profit function changes from positive to negative.

Therefore, the expected profit is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit} = 10 \\times \\text{Expected number of dresses sold} - 5 \\times \\text{Expected number of dresses not sold}\n   \\]\n   The expected number of dresses not sold is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected number of dresses not sold} = x - 0.85x = 0.15x\n   \\]\n   Substituting this into the profit formula, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit} = 10 \\times 0.85x - 5 \\times 0.15x = 8.5x - 0.75x = 7.75x\n   \\]\n   However, this formula does not account for the fixed production capacity constraint.

The expected profit is maximized when the derivative of the profit function with respect to \\( x \\) is zero or the function changes from increasing to decreasing. For \\( x \\leq 5000 \\), the profit function is \\( 7.75x \\), which is a linear function with a positive slope. For \\( x > 5000 \\), the profit function is \\( 75000 - 5x \\), which is a linear function with a negative slope. Therefore, the maximum profit occurs at the point where \\( x = 5000 \\).\n\n   Let's check the expected profit at \\( x = 5000 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected profit at } x = 5000 = 7.75 \\times 5000 = 38750\n   \\]\n   If \\( x > 5000 \\), the expected profit will be less than 38750 because the profit function \\( 75000 - 5x \\) is decreasing.\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of orders the supplier should accept is \\(\\boxed{5000}\\).",

Let's denote the number of orders accepted by the supplier as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the expected number of dresses sold, given that cancellations are normally distributed with a mean of 15% of the orders accepted and a coefficient of variation of 0.5. The mean number of cancellations is \\( 0.15x \\), so the expected number of dresses sold is:\n\\[ x - 0.15x = 0.85x. \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the expected profit. If the supplier sells \\( 0.85x \\) dresses, the profit from these sales is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 0.85x = 8.5x. \\]\n\nHowever, if the supplier produces more dresses than are sold, it will incur a loss. The number of dresses produced is 5,000, so the number of dresses that will be sold if \\( x > 5000 \\) is 5,000. The profit in this case is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 5000 - 5 \\times (x - 5000) = 50000 - 5x + 25000 = 75000 - 5x. \\]\n\nThe expected profit is the weighted average of these two profit scenarios. The probability that \\( x \\leq 5000 \\) is the probability that the number of cancellations is less than or equal to \\( 0.85x \\), and the probability that \\( x > 5000 \\) is the probability that the number of cancellations is greater than \\( 0.85x \\). Since cancellations are normally distributed with mean \\( 0.15x \\) and coefficient of variation 0.5, the standard deviation of the number of cancellations is:\n\\[ 0.5 \\times 0.15x = 0.075x. \\]\n\nThe z-score corresponding to \\( 0.85x \\) is:\n\\[ z = \\frac{0.85x - 0.15x}{0.075x} = \\frac{0.7x}{0.075x} = \\frac{0.7}{0.075} = \\frac{70}{7.5} = \\frac{140}{15} = \\frac{28}{3} \\approx 9.33. \\]\n\nThe probability that a standard normal variable is less than or equal to 9.33 is essentially 1 (since 9.33 is far in the right tail of the distribution). Therefore, the probability that \\( x \\leq 5000 \\) is 1, and the probability that \\( x > 5000 \\) is 0. This means that the supplier will never exceed production capacity if \\( x \\leq 5000 \\), and the expected profit is:\n\\[ 8.5x. \\]\n\nTo maximize the expected profit, the supplier should accept the maximum number of orders that does not exceed production capacity, which is 5,000.
