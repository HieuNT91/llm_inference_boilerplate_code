One order is placed at the beginning of the season. Currently, SO disposes of any unsold jackets at the end of the season to outlet stores at \\$70. It costs \\$10 to hold a jacket in inventory for the entire season and then ship it to an outlet store. Demand for ski jackets has been forecast to be normally distributed, with a mean of 4,000 and a standard deviation of 1,750.

            "To determine the expected profit under the optimal ordering policy for Sport Obermey (SO), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the variables:**\n   - Cost of source per jacket, \\( c = 80 \\)\n   - Selling price per jacket, \\( p = 125 \\)\n   - Disposition price per jacket, \\( v = 70 \\)\n   - holding cost per jacket, \\( h = 10 \\)\n   - Mean demand, \\( \\mu = 4000 \\)\n   - Standard deviation of demand, \\( \\sigma = 1750 \\)\n\n2. **Calculate the critical ratio:**\n   The critical ratio \\( C \\) is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   C = \\frac{p - c}{p - v}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   C = \\frac{125 - 80}{125 - 70} = \\frac{45}{55} = 0.8182\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the optimal order quantity:**\n   The optimal order quantity \\( Q \\) is found by determining the value of \\( Q \\) such that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution with mean \\( \\mu \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\) equals the critical ratio \\( C \\).

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - \\( Q \\): Order quantity\n   - \\( D \\): Demand, which is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 5000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 2000 \\)\n   - \\( C \\): Cost to produce each CD = \\$2\n   - \\( P_s \\): Selling price to Topgamma = \\$3\n   - \\( P_t \\): Selling price to customers = \\$15\n   - \\( D_s \\): Discounted price for unsold CDs = \\$1\n   - \\( \\alpha \\): Topgamma's share of the revenue = 65% = 0.65\n\n2. **Calculate the Revenue and Cost:**\n   - Revenue from selling CDs to Topgamma: \\( 3Q \\) if \\( D \\geq Q \\), \\( 3D + D_s(Q - D) = 3D + (Q - D) = 2D + Q \\) if \\( D < Q \\)\n   - Cost to produce CDs: \\( 2Q \\)\n   - Topgamma's profit if \\( D \\geq Q \\): \\( \\alpha(3Q - 2Q) = 0.65Q \\)\n   - Topgamma's profit if \\( D < Q \\): \\( \\alpha(2D + Q - 2Q) = 0.65(2D - Q) \\)\n\n3. **Expected Profit:**\n   - The expected profit \\( E[\\text{Profit}] \\) is the weighted average of the profit in the two scenarios, where the weights are the probabilities of each scenario.\n   - Let \\( F(x) \\) be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution with mean 5000 and standard deviation 2000.\n   - The probability that \\( D \\geq Q \\) is \\( 1 - F(Q) \\).\n   - The probability that \\( D < Q \\) is \\( F(Q) \\).\n   - Therefore, the expected profit is:\n     \\[\n     E[\\text{Profit}] = (1 - F(Q)) \\cdot 0.65Q + F(Q) \\cdot 0.65(2D - Q) = 0.65[(1 - F(Q))Q + F(Q)(2Q - Q)] = 0.65[(1 - F(Q))Q + F(Q)Q] = 0.65Q\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the Optimal Order Quantity:**\n   - To maximize the expected profit, we need to find the order quantity \\( Q \\) that maximizes the expected profit function.\n   - The expected profit function \\( E[\\text{Profit}] = 0.65Q \\) is linear in \\( Q \\), so the optimal order quantity is the one that maximizes the profit per CD, which is \\$0.65 per CD.\n\n5. **Calculate the Expected Profit:**\n   - Since the expected profit per CD is \\$0.65, the expected profit for Topgamma is:\n     \\[\n     E[\\text{Profit}] = 0.65 \\times Q\n     \\]\n   - To find the optimal order quantity \\( Q \\), we need to consider the New York City's inventory and demand distribution. The optimal order quantity is the one that maximizes the expected profit function, which is \\( Q = 5000 \\).\n\nTherefore, the profit that Topgamma expects to make under its optimal order quantity is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2250}\n\\]",

Since there are no specific costs given for overstocking and understocking, we assume that the critical service level is 100% (i.e., \\( \\alpha = 1 \\)). However, in a more practical scenario, we would use a lower service level based on the costs involved. For simplicity, we will use the service level of 95% (which corresponds to \\( \\alpha = 0.95 \\)).\n\n   The z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.95 is approximately 1.645 (from standard normal distribution tables).\n\n5. **Calculate the optimal order quantity:**\n   \\[\n   Q^* = 250 + 1.645 \\times 50\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Q^* = 250 + 82.25\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Q^* \\approx 332.25\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the integer order quantity:**\n   Since we cannot order a fraction of a unit, we round up to the nearest whole number.\n   \\[\n   Q^* \\approx 333\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, The Kingdom and Alexandria should order \\(\\boxed{333}\\) units of body armor.",

This can be denoted as \\(N(250, 50^2)\\).\n\n2. **Determine the profit per unit**: The selling price of each unit of body armor is \\$650, and the cost to produce each unit is \\$3. Therefore, the profit per unit is:\n   \\[\n   650 - 3 = 647 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the criticality**: The criticality is the probability that the demand will be met. Since The Kingdom and Alexandria are acting independently, we need to find the optimal order quantity that maximizes their expected profit. This involves finding the fill rate that corresponds to a certain service level.\n\n4. **Calculate the service level**: The service level is the probability that the demand will not exceed the order quantity. Let \\(Q\\) be the order quantity. We want to find \\(Q\\) such that the probability of meet the demand is maximized.\n\n5. **Use the standard normal distribution**: To find the fill rate, we need to convert the service level into a standard normal distribution value.

The standard normal variable \\(Z\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n   \\]\n   We need to find \\(Z\\) such that \\(P(Z \\leq Z_{\\text{ fill}}) = \\text{Fill rate}\\).\n\n6. **Determine the fill rate**: Since we are not given a specific service level, we will assume a high service level to ensure that The Kingdom and Alexandria have a high probability of meeting the demand. A common service level is 95%.\n\n7. **Find the corresponding Z-score**: From the standard normal distribution table, the Z-score corresponding to a fill rate of 95% is approximately 1.645.\n\n8. **Calculate the order quantity**: Using the Z-score, we can find the order quantity \\(Q\\):\n   \\[\n   Q = \\mu + Z_{\\text{ fill}} \\cdot \\sigma\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values, we get:\n   \\[\n   Q = 250 + 1.645 \\cdot 50\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Q = 250 + 82.25\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Q = 332.25\n   \\]\n\nSince the order quantity must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number:\n   \\[\n   Q = 333\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, The Kingdom and Alexandria should order \\(\\boxed{333}\\) units of body armor.",

However, since we are dealing with a continuous distribution, we can consider the cost at \\( Q = 100 + \\epsilon \\) for a very small \\( \\epsilon \\).\n\nTo find the exact optimal \\( Q \\), we need to compare the cost at \\( Q = 100 \\) and the cost at \\( Q = 100 + \\epsilon \\):\n\\[\nC(100) = -50 \\times 100 = -5000\n\\]\n\\[\nC(100 + \\epsilon) = 220(100 + \\epsilon) - 25000 = 22000 + 220\\epsilon - 25000 = -3000 + 220\\epsilon\n\\]\nSince \\( \\epsilon \\) is very small, \\( 220\\epsilon \\) is also very small, and \\( -3000 + 220\\epsilon \\) is slightly less than -3000. Therefore, the optimal \\( Q \\) is slightly greater than 100. To find the exact value, we can use the newsmen's rule, which states that the optimal \\( Q \\) is such that the probability of demand being less than or equal to \\( Q \\) is \\( \\frac{220}{220 + 50} = \\frac{220}{270} = \\frac{22}{27} \\).\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution, we find the z-score corresponding to \\( \\frac{22}{27} \\):\n\\[\nP(Z \\leq z) = \\frac{22}{27} \\approx 0.8148\n\\]\nThe z-score corresponding to 0.8148 is approximately 0.89. Therefore:\n\\[\nQ = \\mu + z\\sigma = 100 + 0.89 \\times 40 = 100 + 35.6 =",

            "To determine the safety inventory that Monson Kitchen currently carries, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the annual holding cost per door:**\n   The holding cost per door is 22% of the cost of each door.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Holding cost per door} = 0.22 \\times 14 = 3.08 \\text{ euros}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the cycle service level:**\n   Monson Kitchen orders 11,000 doors when the inventory drops to 7,500. This means that they order when the inventory is 11,000 - 7,500 = 3,500 doors short. The cycle service level is the probability that the demand during the lead time will not exceed the initial inventory minus the safety stock.\n\n   The lead time is two weeks, so the total demand during the lead time is normally distributed with a mean of \\(2 \\times 3000 = 6000\\) doors and a standard deviation of \\(2 \\times 550 = 1100\\) doors.\n\n   We need to find the z-score corresponding to the safety stock of 3,500 doors. The z-score is given by:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{3500 - 6000}{1100} = -2.27\n   \\]\n\n   Using a standard normal distribution table, we find that the probability of a z-score of -2.27 is approximately 0.0115. This means the cycle service level is 98.85%.\n\n3. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is the number of doors that corresponds to the z-score of -2.27.

            "To determine how many CDs Topgamma expects to sell at a discount under its optimal order quantity, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the optimal order quantity:**\n   - The cost to produce each CD for the studio is \\( \\$2 \\).\n   - The selling price of each CD to Topgamma is \\( \\$3 \\).\n   - The price at which Topgamma sells each CD is \\( \\$15 \\).\n   - The discount price for unsold CDs is \\( \\$1 \\).\n   - Topgamma shares 35% of the revenue with the studio, so it keeps 65% for itself.\n\n   We use the newsvendor model to find the optimal order quantity. The critical ratio \\( C \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   C = \\frac{p - c}{p - v}\n   \\]\n   where \\( p \\) is the selling price to Topgamma, \\( c \\) is the production cost, and \\( v \\) is the discount price.\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   C = \\frac{3 - 2}{3 - 1} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\n   \\]\n\n   The optimal order quantity \\( Q \\) is found using the critical ratio and the demand distribution.

Each phone charger costs the supplier \u20ac3 to produce. The phone charger will be sold to Rodgers Electronics for \u20ac4. Rodgers Electronics, in turn, prices a phone charger at \u20ac20 and forecasts demand to be normally distributed, with a mean of 8,000 and a standard deviation of 2,500. Any unsold phone chargers are discounted to \u20ac2, and all sell at this price. Rodgers Electronics will share 40 percent of the revenue with the supplier, keeping 60 percent for itself.

            "To determine how many phone chargers Rodgers electronics should order, we need to calculate the optimal order quantity that maximizes their expected profit. This involves considering the cost of producing the chargers, the revenue from selling them, and the potential savings from unsold chargers.\n\nLet's denote the order quantity by \\( Q \\). The cost of producing \\( Q \\) chargers for the supplier is \\( 3Q \\) euros. The revenue from selling the chargers to Rodgers electronics is \\( 4Q \\) euros. Rodgers electronics will then share 40% of this revenue with the supplier and keep 60% for themselves. Therefore, the revenue that Rodgers electronics keeps from the sales is \\( 0.6 \\times 4Q = 2.4Q \\) euros.\n\nIf the demand is \\( D \\) chargers, then the number of unsold chargers is \\( Q - D \\). The revenue from selling the unsold chargers is \\( 2(Q - D) \\) euros. The total revenue that Rodgers electronics receives is the revenue from the sold chargers plus the revenue from the unsold chargers, which is \\( 2.4D + 2(Q - D) = 0.4D + 2Q \\) euros. The profit that Rodgers electronics makes is the total revenue minus the cost of producing the chargers, which is \\( 0.4D + 2Q - 3Q = 0.4D - Q \\) euros.\n\nSince the demand \\( D \\) is normally distributed with a mean of 8000 and a standard deviation of 2500, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that maximizes the expected profit. The expected profit is given by the expected value of \\( 0.4D - Q \\), which is \\( 0.4 \\times 8000 - Q = 3200 - Q \\) plus the expected value of the revenue from the unsold chargers, which is \\( 2 \\times \\text{expected value of } (Q - D)^+ \\).\n\nThe expected value of \\( (Q - D)^+ \\) can be calculated using the properties of the normal distribution. The expected value of the positive part of a normally distributed variable \\( X \\) with mean \\( \\mu \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\) is given by \\( \\sigma \\phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu - Q}{\\sigma}\\right) + (Q - \\mu) \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu - Q}{\\sigma}\\right) \\), where \\( \\phi \\) is the standard normal density function and \\( \\Phi \\) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.\n\nHere, \\( \\mu = 8000 \\), \\( \\sigma = 2500 \\), and \\( X = D - Q \\). Therefore, the expected value of \\( (Q - D)^+ \\) is \\( 2500 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 8000}{2500}\\right) + (8000 - Q) \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 8000}{2500}\\right) \\).\n\nThe expected profit is then \\( 3200 - Q + 2 \\times (2500 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 8000}{2500}\\right) + (8000 - Q) \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 8000}{2500}\\right)) = 3200 - Q + 5000 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 8000}{2500}\\right) + 2(8000 - Q) \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 8000}{2500}\\right) = 3200 - Q + 5000 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 8000}{2500}\\right) + 16000 \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 8000}{2500}\\right) - 2Q \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 8000}{2500}\\right) = 3200 + 16000 \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 8000}{2500}\\right) - 3Q + 5000 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 8000}{2500}\\right) - 2Q \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 8000}{2500}\\right) \\).\n\nTo maximize this expected profit, we take the derivative with respect to \\( Q",
