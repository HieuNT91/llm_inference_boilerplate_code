Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the lead time demand:**\n   - The lead time is 1.5 weeks.\n   - The weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 1500 and a standard deviation of 300.\n   - The lead time demand is the demand over the lead time period.\n   - Mean lead time demand = Mean weekly demand * Lead time = 1500 * 1.5 = 2250.\n   - Standard deviation of lead time demand = Standard deviation weekly demand * sqrt( lead time) = 300 * sqrt(1.5) = 300 * 1.2247 = 367.42.\n\n2. **Determine the z-score for the service level:**\n   - A service level of 95 percent means that we need to find the z-score that corresponds to the 95th percentile of the standard normal distribution.\n   - From the standard normal distribution table, the z-score for the 95th percentile is approximately 1.645.\n\n3. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   - Safety stock = z-score * Standard deviation of lead time demand = 1.645 * 367.42 = 603.99.\n   - Since inventory is typically expressed as a whole number, we round 603.99 to the nearest whole number, which is 604.\n\nTherefore, the safety inventory of corn tortillas that Big Truck should carry is \\(\\boxed{604}\\).",
            "To determine the amount of safety inventory of corn tortillas that Big Truck Tacos should carry, we need to calculate the safety stock based on the lead time and the desired service level (CSL).

This value can be found using standard normal distribution tables or a calculator.\n\n3. **Calculate the standard deviation of demand over the lead time:**\n   - The standard deviation of weekly demand (\u03c3) is 300.\n   - The standard deviation of demand over 1.5 weeks (\u03c3_L) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\sigma_L = \\sigma \\sqrt{L} = 300 \\sqrt{1.5} = 300 \\times 1.2247 = 367.41\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   - The safety stock (SS) is given by the z-score multiplied by the standard deviation of demand over the lead time:\n     \\[\n     SS = Z \\times \\sigma_L = 1.645 \\times 367.41 = 606.04\n     \\]\n\n5. **Round the safety stock to the nearest whole number:**\n   - Since inventory cannot be expressed in fractions, we round 606.04 to 606.\n\nTherefore, the safety inventory of corn tortillas that Big Truck Tacos should carry is \\boxed{606}."

            "To determine the fill rate for Sam's Club store, we need to calculate the probability that the store will have enough printers to meet the demand over the two-week period following an order. Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the demand distribution:**\n   - Mean (\\(\\mu\\)) = 250 printers per week.\n   - Standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) = 150 printers per week.\n\n2. **Calculate the total demand over two weeks:**\n   - Total mean demand over two weeks: \\(\\mu_{2\\text{ weeks}} = 250 \\times 2 = 500\\) printers.\n   - Total standard deviation over two weeks: \\(\\sigma_{2\\text{ weeks}} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 150 \\approx 212.13\\) printers.\n\n3. **Determine the initial inventory and order quantity:**\n   - Initial inventory when an order is placed: 600 printers.\n   - Order quantity: 1,000 printers.\n\n4. **Calculate the total available inventory after the order:**\n   - Total available inventory = Initial inventory + Order quantity = 600 + 1,000 = 1,600 printers.\n\n5. **Set up the inequality to find the probability:**\n   - We need to find the probability that the total demand over two weeks is less than or equal to the total available inventory.\n   - Let \\(X\\) be the total demand over two weeks. We need \\(P(X \\leq 1600)\\).\n\n6. **Standardize the normal distribution:**\n   - Convert \\(X\\) to a standard normal variable \\(Z\\):\n     \\[\n     Z = \\frac{X - \\mu_{2\\text{ weeks}}}{\\sigma_{2\\text{ weeks}}} = \\frac{1600 - 500}{212.13} \\approx 4.71\n     \\]\n\n7. **Find the probability using the standard normal distribution table:**\n   - Look up the value \\(Z = 4.71\\) in the standard normal distribution table. The table gives the cumulative probability up to \\(Z\\).\n   - For \\(Z = 4.71\\), the cumulative probability is approximately 1.0000.\n\n8. **Calculate the fill rate:**\n   - The fill rate is the probability that the demand will be satisfied, which is \\(P(X \\leq 1600)\\).\n   - Since the cumulative probability for \\(Z = 4.71\\) is 1.0000, the fill rate is 100%.\n\nTherefore, the fill rate the store achieves is \\(\\boxed{1.00}\\).",

Since the store starts with 600 printers and orders 1,000 printers, the total number of printers available to meet the demand over the two weeks is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total printers available} = 600 + 1,000 = 1,600 \\text{ printers}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the fill rate:**\n   The fill rate is the ratio of the total number of printers demand to the total number of printers available.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the review period and lead time:**\n   - Review period = 4 weeks\n   - Lead time = 2 weeks\n   - Total period = Review period + Lead time = 4 weeks + 2 weeks = 6 weeks\n\n2. **Calculate the expected demand over the total period:**\n   - Mean weekly demand = 2,500 boxes\n   - Expected demand over 6 weeks = Mean weekly demand * Total period = 2,500 boxes/week * 6 weeks = 15,000 boxes\n\n3. **Determine the standard deviation of the demand over the total period:**\n   - Standard deviation of weekly demand = 500 boxes\n   - Standard deviation of demand over 6 weeks = Standard deviation of weekly demand * sqrt(Total period) = 500 boxes * sqrt(6) \u2248 500 * 2.449 = 1,224.74 boxes\n\n4. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   - The store manager has not specified a service level, so we'll assume a common service level of 95%.

            "The store's safety inventory is the number of printers the store carries to ensure it does not run out of printers during the lead time. The lead time is the time it takes for an order to be filled, which is 2 weeks. The store manager currently orders 1,000 printers each time the inventory drops to 600 printers.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the expected demand over the 2-week lead time. Since the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 250 and a standard deviation of 150, the expected demand over 2 weeks is:\n\\[ 250 \\times 2 = 500 \\text{ printers} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the safety stock. The safety stock is the difference between the order quantity and the expected demand over the lead time. The order quantity is 1,000 printers, and the expected demand over 2 weeks is 500 printers. Therefore, the safety stock is:\n\\[ 1000 - 500 = 500 \\text{ printers} \\]\n\nHowever, the store currently has 600 printers in inventory when it places an order. This means that the safety stock is actually the difference between the current inventory when an order is placed and the expected demand over the lead time. The current inventory when an order is placed is 600 printers, and the expected demand over 2 weeks is 500 printers. Therefore, the safety stock is:\n\\[ 600 - 500 = 100 \\text{ printers} \\]\n\nThus, the store carries \\(\\boxed{100}\\) safety inventory.",

The safety stock is determined based on the desired service level, but since it is not explicitly given, we will assume the store manager's ordering policy implies a certain service level.\n\n1. **Calculate the lead time demand:**\n   The mean demand per week is 250 printers.

For this problem, let's assume a service level of 95%.\n\n3. **Find the z-score for the service level:**\n   The z-score corresponding to a 95% service level is approximately 1.645 (from standard normal distribution tables).\n\n4. **Calculate the optimal number of calendars to print:**\n   The optimal number of calendars to print (\\(Q\\)) can be found using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Q = \\mu + z \\cdot \\sigma\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   Q = 70,000 + 1.645 \\cdot 25,000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Q = 70,000 + 41,125\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Q = 111,125\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   The publisher should print approximately 111,125 calendars to meet the demand with a 95% service level. However, since the problem typically asks for a whole number, we might round this number to the nearest whole number, but given the context and typical problem setup, the answer is often given as the integer value calculated directly from the formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{111125}\\).",
            "To determine how many calendars the publisher should print, we need to consider the costs and revenues associated with printing and selling the calendars. We'll use the concept of expected profit to make our decision.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( Q \\) as the number of calendars printed.\n- \\( D \\) as the demand for calendars, which is normally distributed with a mean of 70,000 and a standard deviation of 25,000.\n- \\( C \\) as the cost per calendar, which is \\$3.\n- \\( P \\) as the selling price per calendar, which is \\$10.\n\nThe profit for printing \\( Q \\) calendars can be expressed as follows:\n- If \\( D \\leq Q \\), all \\( D \\) calendars are sold, and the profit is \\( P \\cdot D - C \\cdot Q \\).\n- If \\( D > Q \\), only \\( Q \\) calendars are sold, and the profit is \\( P \\cdot Q - C \\cdot Q \\).\n\nThe expected profit \\( E[Profit] \\) is the weighted average of these two scenarios, where the weights are the probabilities of each scenario occurring. The probability that demand is less than or equal to \\( Q \\) is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution, denoted as \\( \\Phi \\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) \\), and the probability that demand is greater than \\( Q \\) is \\( 1 - \\Phi \\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) \\).\n\nThe expected profit can be written as:\n\\[ E[Profit] = (P \\cdot D - C \\cdot Q) \\cdot \\Phi \\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) + (P \\cdot Q - C \\cdot Q) \\cdot (1 - \\Phi \\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)) \\]\n\\[ E[Profit] = (P - C) \\cdot Q \\cdot \\Phi \\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) + P \\cdot D \\cdot \\Phi \\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) - P \\cdot Q \\cdot (1 - \\Phi \\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)) - C \\cdot Q \\cdot (1 - \\Phi \\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)) \\]\n\\[ E[Profit] = (P - C) \\cdot Q \\cdot \\Phi \\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) + P \\cdot D \\cdot \\Phi \\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) - P \\cdot Q + P \\cdot Q \\cdot \\Phi \\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) - C \\cdot Q + C \\cdot Q \\cdot \\Phi \\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) \\]\n\\[ E[Profit] = (P - C) \\cdot Q \\cdot \\Phi \\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) + P \\cdot D \\cdot \\Phi \\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) - P \\cdot Q - C \\cdot Q + C \\cdot Q \\cdot \\Phi \\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) \\]\n\\[ E[Profit] = P \\cdot D \\cdot \\Phi \\left( \\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) - C \\cdot Q \\]\n\\[ E[Profit] = 10 \\cdot D \\cdot \\Phi \\left( \\frac{Q - 70,000}{25,000} \\right) - 3 \\cdot Q \\]\n\nTo maximize the expected profit, we take the derivative of \\( E[Profit] \\) with respect to \\( Q \\) and set it to zero:\n\\[ \\frac{dE[Profit]}{dQ} = 10 \\cdot D \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\sigma} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\cdot e^{-\\frac{(Q - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} - 3 = 0 \\]\n\\[ 10 \\cdot D \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\cdot 25,000} \\cdot e^{-\\frac{(Q - 70,000)^2}{2 \\cdot 25,000^2}} = 3 \\]\n",
            "To determine how many calendars the publisher should print, we need to consider the costs and benefits of printing too many or too few calendars. Specifically, we need to balance the cost of printing too many calendars (which would result in a loss if they are not sold) against the cost of printing too few calendars (which would result in lost sales).\n\nLet's define the following variables:\n- \\( Q \\): the number of calendars printed.\n- \\( D \\): the demand for calendars, which is normally distributed with a mean of 70,000 and a standard deviation of 25,000.\n- \\( C \\): the cost per calendar, which is \\$3.\n- \\( P \\): the selling price per calendar, which is \\$10.\n\nThe profit from selling a calendar is \\( P - C = 10 - 3 = 7 \\) dollars. The loss fromRecycling an unsold calendar is \\( C = 3 \\) dollars.\n\nThe expected profit \\( E[Profit] \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ E[Profit] = E[(D \\cdot 7) - ((Q - D) \\cdot 3)] = E[7D - 3Q + 3D] = E[10D - 3Q] = 10E[D] - 3Q \\]\nSince \\( E[D] = 70,000 \\), we have:\n\\[ E[Profit] = 10 \\cdot 70,000 - 3Q = 700,000 - 3Q \\]\n\nHowever, this formula does not account for the fact that if the demand \\( D \\) is less than the number of calendars printed \\( Q \\), the loss from recycling the unsold calendars is only \\( C \\cdot (Q - D) = 3 \\cdot (Q - D) \\). Therefore, the expected profit considering the recycling cost is:\n\\[ E[Profit] = E[10D - 3Q - 3(Q - D) \\cdot \\mathbb{I}_{D < Q}] = E[10D - 3Q - 3Q + 3D \\cdot \\mathbb{I}_{D < Q}] = E[13D - 6Q - 3D \\cdot \\mathbb{I}_{D < Q}] \\]\nwhere \\( \\mathbb{I}_{D < Q} \\) is an indicator function that is 1 if \\( D < Q \\) and 0 otherwise.\n\nTo maximize the expected profit, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) such that the marginal increase in expected profit is zero. This means we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) such that the expected profit from printing one more calendar is zero.\n\nThe expected profit from printing one more calendar is:\n\\[ E[Profit(Q+1) - Profit(Q)] = E[13D - 6(Q+1) - 3D \\cdot \\mathbb{I}_{D < Q+1} - (13D - 6Q - 3D \\cdot \\mathbb{I}_{D < Q})] = E[-6 + 3D \\cdot (\\mathbb{I}_{D < Q+1} - \\mathbb{I}_{D < Q})] \\]\n\nThe term \\( \\mathbb{I}_{D < Q+1} - \\mathbb{I}_{D < Q} \\) is 1 if \\( D < Q \\) and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the expected profit from printing one more calendar is:\n\\[ E[Profit(Q+1) - Profit(Q)] = E[-6 + 3D \\cdot (D < Q)] = -6 + 3E[D | D < Q] \\]\n\nWe need to find \\( Q \\) such that:\n\\[ -6 + 3E[D | D < Q] = 0 \\]\n\\[ E[D | D < Q] = 2 \\]\n\nSince \\( D \\) is normally distributed with a mean of 70,000 and a standard deviation of 25,000, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) such that the expected value of \\( D \\) given that \\( D < Q \\) is 2. This is equivalent to finding the value of \\( Q \\) such that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of \\( D \\) evaluated at \\( Q \\) is such that the conditional expectation is 2.\n\nUsing the properties of the normal distribution, we can use the fact that the conditional expectation of a normal distribution given that it is less than a certain value is given by:\n\\[ E[D | D < Q] = \\mu - \\sigma \\frac{\\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)}{\\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - \\",

In the second month, the store will sell another 650 jackets, so it will have 550 - 650 + 550 = 450 jackets left at the end of the second month. This pattern continues, so the average inventory level is the average of the inventory at the end of each month.\n\nThe inventory at the end of each month is:\n- End of Month 1: 550 jackets\n- End of Month 2: 450 jackets\n- End of Month 3: 350 jackets\n- End of Month 4: 250 jackets\n- End of Month 5: 150 jackets\n- End of Month 6: 50 jackets\n- End of Month 7: -50 jackets (but since the store cannot have a negative inventory, it means the store has sold all 550 jackets and is short by 50 jackets, so the actual inventory is 0 jackets)\n- End of Month 8: -100 jackets (but the actual inventory is 0 jackets)\n- End of Month 9: -150 jackets (but the actual inventory is 0 jackets)\n- End of Month 10: -200 jackets (but the actual inventory is 0 jackets)\n- End of Month 11: -250 jackets (but the actual inventory is 0 jackets)\n- End of Month 12: -300 jackets (but the actual inventory is 0 jackets)\n\nThe average inventory level is the average of the inventory at the end of each month.

            "To determine the optimal order quantity and the expected profit, we need to use the newsvendor model. The newsvendor model is used to find the optimal order quantity for a product with uncertain demand, where the cost of overominator (stituting out of stock) and the cost of underominator (not meeting demand) are important factors.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- \\( D \\) is the demand for the calendar, which is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 70,000 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 25,000 \\).\n- \\( Q \\) is the order quantity.\n- \\( c = 3 \\) is the cost per calendar.\n- \\( p = 10 \\) is the selling price per calendar.\n- The profit per calendar sold is \\( p - c = 10 - 3 = 7 \\).\n- The cost of unsold calendar (overominator cost) is \\( c = 3 \\) (since they are recycled).\n\nThe optimal order quantity \\( Q^* \\) is given by the critical fractile of the standard normal distribution, which is determined by the ratio of the overominator cost to the total cost (overominator cost + profit per calendar sold). The critical fractile \\( F \\) is given by:\n\\[ F = \\frac{p - c}{p} = \\frac{10 - 3}{10} = 0.7. \\]\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( Q^* \\) such that the probability that the demand \\( D \\) is less than or equal to \\( Q^* \\) is 0.7. This corresponds to the 70th percentile of the standard normal distribution. Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.7 is approximately 0.5244. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ Q^* = \\mu + z \\sigma = 70,000 + 0.5244 \\times 25,000 = 70,000 + 13,110 = 83,110. \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the expected profit. The expected profit \\( E[Profit] \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ E[Profit] = E[Revenue] - E[Cost]. \\]\n\nThe expected revenue \\( E[Revenue] \\) is the selling price per calendar times the expected number of calendars sold. The expected number of calendars sold is the mean of the demand distribution minus the expected number of unsold calendars. The expected number of unsold calendar is the order quantity minus the expected demand, but only if the order quantity is greater than the expected demand. The expected number of unsold calendar can be calculated using the critical fractile:\n\\[ E[Unsold] = Q^* - E[D] + \\sigma \\phi(z), \\]\nwhere \\( \\phi(z) \\) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution at \\( z \\).

The expected value of the minimum of a normal random variable \\( D \\) and a constant \\( Q \\) is given by:\n\\[ E[\\min(Q, D)] = Q - \\sigma \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) + \\mu \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) \\]\nwhere \\( \\phi \\) is the standard normal density function and \\( \\Phi \\) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.\n\nThe optimal order quantity \\( Q^* \\) is found by setting the derivative of the expected profit with respect to \\( Q \\) to zero. The derivative of the expected profit is:\n\\[ \\frac{dE[\\text{Profit}]}{dQ} = p \\left(1 - \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)\\right) - c \\]\n\nSetting this equal to zero, we get:\n\\[ p \\left(1 - \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)\\right) = c \\]\n\\[ 1 - \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\frac{c}{p} \\]\n\\[ \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{c}{p} \\]\n\\[ \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{3}{10} = 0.7 \\]\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( z \\) such that \\( \\phi(z) = 0.7 \\). Using standard normal tables or a calculator, we find that \\( z \\approx 0.5244 \\). Therefore:\n\\[ \\frac{Q^* - 70,000}{25,000} = 0.5244 \\]\n\\[ Q^* = 70,000 + 0.5244 \\times 25,000 \\]\n\\[ Q^* = 70,000 + 13,110 \\]\n\\[ Q^* = 83,110 \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the expected profit at \\( Q^* = 83,110 \\):\n\\[ E[\\min(83,110, D)] = 83,110 - 25,000 \\phi\\left(\\frac{83,110 - 70,000}{25,000}\\right) + 70,000 \\Phi\\left(\\frac{83,110 - 70,000}{25,000}\\right) \\]\n\\[ E[\\min(83,110, D)] = 83,110 - 25,000 \\phi(0.5244) + 70,000 \\Phi(0.5244) \\]\n\\[ E[\\min(83,110, D)] = 83,110 - 25,000 \\times 0.6940 + 70,000 \\times 0.7 \\]\n\\[ E[\\min(83,110, D)] = 83,110 - 17,350 + 49,000 \\]\n\\[ E[\\min(83,",
