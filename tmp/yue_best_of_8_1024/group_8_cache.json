            "To determine the maximal expected profit that Green thumb can achieve, we need to analyze the profit function and the demand distribution. Let's denote the number of units produced by \\( Q \\). The profit function can be expressed as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = (\\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost of production}) - \\text{Cost of unsold units} + \\text{Revenue from unsold units} \\]\n\nThe revenue from selling the units is \\( 200 \\times \\min(Q, D) \\), where \\( D \\) is the demand. The cost of production is \\( 150Q \\). The cost of holding unsold units is \\( 20 \\times (Q - D)^+ \\), where \\( (Q - D)^+ = \\max(Q - D, 0) \\). The revenue from unsold units is \\( 50 \\times (Q - D)^+ \\). Therefore, the profit function can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 200 \\times \\min(Q, D) - 150Q - 20 \\times (Q - D)^+ + 50 \\times (Q - D)^+ = 200 \\times \\min(Q, D) - 150Q + 30 \\times (Q - D)^+ \\]\n\nTo maximize the expected profit, we need to find the optimal \\( Q \\). The expected profit is given by:\n\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = 200E[\\min(Q, D)] - 150Q + 30E[(Q - D)^+] \\]\n\nSince \\( D \\) is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 100 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 40 \\), we can use the properties of the normal distribution to find \\( E[\\min(Q, D)] \\) and \\( E[(Q - D)^+] \\).\n\nFirst, let's find \\( E[\\min(Q, D)] \\). The expected value of the minimum of a normal random variable and a constant can be calculated using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and the probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution. Specifically:\n\n\\[ E[\\min(Q, D)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} x f(x) \\, dx + Q \\int_{Q}^{\\infty} f(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} x f(x) \\, dx + Q (1 - F(Q)) \\]\n\nwhere \\( f(x) \\) is the PDF of the normal distribution and \\( F(x) \\) is the CDF. For a normal distribution with mean \\( \\mu = 100 \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma = 40 \\), we have:\n\n\\[ F(Q) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 100}{40}\\right) \\]\n\\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{40\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x-100)^2}{2 \\cdot 40^2}} \\]\n\nThe integral \\( \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} x f(x) \\, dx \\) can be evaluated as \\( 100 F(Q) + 40 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 100}{40}\\right) \\), where \\( \\phi(x) \\) is the PDF of the standard normal distribution. Therefore:\n\n\\[ E[\\min(Q, D)] = 100 F(Q) + 40 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 100}{40}\\right) + Q (1 - F(Q)) = 40 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 100}{40}\\right) + Q \\]\n\nNext, let's find \\( E[(Q - D)^+] \\). The expected value of the positive part of the difference between a normal random variable and a constant can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ E[(Q - D)^+] = \\int_{Q}^{\\infty} (Q - x) f(x) \\, dx = Q (1 - F(Q)) - \\int_{Q}^{\\infty} x f(x) \\, dx = Q (1 - F(Q)) - (100 F(Q) + 40 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 100}{40}\\right)) = Q - 100 F(Q) - 40 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - 100}{40}\\right) \\]\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the expected profit function, we get:\n\n\\[ E[\\text{Profit}] = 200 (40 \\phi\\left(\\frac{Q - ",

The average number of students is 850, and the standard deviation is 70. To be prepared for the worst-case scenario, we should consider the upper bound of the number of students, which is the mean plus a few standard deviations. However, since the problem does not specify how many standard deviations to consider, we will use the mean plus one standard deviation to ensure we have enough covers.\n\n\\[\n850 + 1 \\times 70 = 920\n\\]\n\nSo, the university should plan to have at least 920 diploma covers.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many boxes of diploma covers to order from the bookstore. Each box contains 144 covers, so we divide the total number of covers needed by the number of covers per box:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{920}{144} \\approx 6.39\n\\]\n\nSince the bookstore is unwilling to break bulk, the university must order whole boxes.

Therefore, the university should order 5 boxes of diploma covers from the bookstore and obtain 130 additional covers from the black market.\n\nThe number of additional covers the university must obtain from the black market is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{130}\n\\]",
            "To determine the optimal number of boxes of diploma covers the university should order from the bookstore, we need to consider the average number of students, the standard deviation, and the cost structure.\n\n1. **Calculate the expected number of students:**\n   The average number of students at commencement is 850.\n\n2. **Determine the number of boxes to order:**\n   Each box contains 144 diploma covers.

Therefore, they have:\n   \\[\n   864 - 850 = 14\n   \\]\n   extra covers. However, we need to consider the standard deviation to ensure they have enough covers even in the worst-case scenario (i.e., the number of students is at the upper end of the range).\n\n5. **Calculate the upper bound of the number of students:**\n   To be extra careful, we can consider the upper bound of the number of students, which is the average plus one standard deviation:\n   \\[\n   850 + 70 = 920\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the additional covers needed to meet the upper bound:**\n   If the university needs 920 covers and they are ordering 864 covers, the number of additional covers needed is:\n   \\[\n   920 - 864 = 56\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the university must obtain \\(\\boxed{56}\\) additional covers from the black market.",
            "To determine the optimal number of boxes of diploma covers the university should order from the bookstore, we need to balance the cost of ordering boxes with the cost of purchasing additional covers on the black market.

The profit Topgamma makes from selling the CDs can be broken down into the revenue from selling the CDs and the cost of the CDs.\n\n1. **Revenue from selling CDs:**\n   - If \\( D \\) is the number of CDs sold, the revenue from selling \\( D \\) CDs at \\$15 each is \\( 15D \\).\n   - The revenue from selling unsold CDs at \\$1 each is \\( 1 \\times (Q - D) = Q - D \\).\n   - Therefore, the total revenue is \\( 15D + Q - D = 14D + Q \\).\n\n2. **Cost of producing CDs:**\n   - The cost of producing \\( Q \\) CDs is \\( 2Q \\).\n\n3. **Topgamma's share of the revenue:**\n   - Topgamma shares 35% of the total revenue, so Topgamma's share is \\( 0.35 \\times (14D + Q) = 4.9D + 0.35Q \\).\n\n4. **Topgamma's profit:**\n   - Topgamma's profit is the topgamma's share of the revenue minus the cost of the CDs, which is \\( 4.9D + 0.35Q - 2Q = 4.9D - 1.65Q \\).\n\nSince the demand \\( D \\) is normally distributed with a mean of 5,000 and a standard deviation of 2,000, we need to find the expected value of Topgamma's profit. The expected value of \\( D \\) is 5,000, so the expected profit is \\( 4.9 \\times 5000 - 1.65Q = 24500 - 1.65Q \\).\n\nHowever, this formula only gives us the expected profit if we order exactly 5,000 CDs. To find the optimal order quantity, we need to consider the possibility of ordering more or fewer CDs and the associated costs and benefits.\n\nLet's consider the expected profit if Topgamma orders \\( Q \\) CDs. If \\( Q \\) is less than the mean demand, there is a risk of not meeting the demand and missing out on potential sales. If \\( Q \\) is more than the mean demand, there is a risk of having unsold CDs and incurring a cost for them.\n\nTo find the optimal order quantity, we need to calculate the expected profit for different values of \\( Q \\) and find the value that maximizes this profit. This involves calculating the expected profit for each possible value of \\( Q \\) and comparing them.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, we find that the optimal order quantity is 6,000 CDs. This is because ordering 6,000 CDs balances the risk of not meeting the demand and the risk of having unsold CDs.\n\nTherefore, the number of CDs Topgamma should order is \\(\\boxed{6000}\\).",

Let's denote the number of CDs ordered by \\( Q \\).\n\nFirst, let's define the profit function. The profit Topun makes consists of the revenue from selling the CDs minus the cost of the CDs. The revenue from selling the CDs is the number of CDs sold multiplied by the selling price minus the discount for unsold CDs. The cost of the CDs is the number of CDs ordered multiplied by the production cost.\n\nThe revenue from selling the CDs can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\text{Revenue} = (\\text{number of CDs sold}) \\times (\\text{selling price} - \\text{discount}) + (\\text{number of unsold CDs}) \\times \\text{discount} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Revenue} = (\\text{number of CDs sold}) \\times \\$14 + (\\text{number of unsold CDs}) \\times \\$1 \\]\n\nThe number of CDs sold is the minimum of the number of CDs ordered and the number of CDs demanded.

            "To determine how many CDs Topgun should order, we need to calculate the optimal order quantity that maximizes Topgraph's expected profit. This involves considering the costs, revenues, and probabilities associated with different levels of demand.\n\nLet's denote the number of CDs Topgraph orders by \\( Q \\). The cost to produce \\( Q \\) CDs is \\( 2Q \\) dollars. Topgraph pays the studio \\( 0.43 \\times 2Q = 0.86Q \\) dollars, so Topgraph's cost is \\( 0.14Q \\) dollars.\n\nThe revenue Topgraph earns from selling the CDs depends on the demand. If the demand \\( D \\) is less than or equal to \\( Q \\), Topgraph sells \\( D \\) CDs at \\$15 each, and the revenue is \\( 15D \\). If the demand \\( D \\) is greater than \\( Q \\), Topgraph sells \\( Q \\) CDs at \\$15 each and the remaining \\( D - Q \\) CDs at \\$1 each, so the revenue is \\( 15Q + 1(D - Q) = 14Q + D \\).\n\nTopgraph's profit is the revenue minus the cost. Therefore, the profit function \\( P(Q, D) \\) is:\n\\[ P(Q, D) = \\begin{cases} \n15D - 0.14Q & \\text{if } D \\leq Q \\\\\n14Q + D - 0.14Q = 13.86Q + D & \\text{if } D > Q \n\\end{cases} \\]\n\nThe expected profit \\( E[P(Q)] \\) is the weighted average of the profit over all possible values of \\( D \\), where the weights are the probabilities of each demand level. Since the demand \\( D \\) is normally distributed with a mean of 5,000 and a standard deviation of 2,000, we can use the properties of the normal distribution to find the expected profit.\n\nThe expected profit can be written as:\n\\[ E[P(Q)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{Q} (15D - 0.14Q) f(D) \\, dD + \\int_{Q}^{\\infty} (13.86Q + D) f(D) \\, dD \\]\nwhere \\( f(D) \\) is the probability density function of the normal distribution \\( N(5000, 2000^2) \\).\n\nTo find the optimal order quantity \\( Q \\), we need to take the derivative of \\( E[P(Q)] \\) with respect to \\( Q \\) and set it to zero. The derivative of \\( E[P(Q)] \\) is:\n\\[ \\frac{dE[P(Q)]}{dQ} = 15F(Q) - 0.14 + (13.86Q + Qf(Q)) - f(Q) = 15F(Q) + 13.86Q + Qf(Q) - f(Q) - 0.14 = 15F(Q) + 14Qf(Q) - f(Q) - 0.14 = 14Qf(Q) + (15 - 1)F(Q) - 0.14 = 14Qf(Q) + 14F(Q) - 0.14 = 14(Qf(Q) + F(Q)) - 0.14 \\]\nwhere \\( F(Q) \\) is the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution.\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero, we get:\n\\[ 14(Qf(Q) + F(Q)) - 0.14 = 0 \\]\n\\[ Qf(Q) + F(Q) = 0.01 \\]\n\nThe term \\( Qf(Q) + F(Q) \\) is the inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution function evaluated at the standard normal quantile corresponding to the service level. The service level is the probability that the demand is less than or equal to \\( Q \\), which is \\( F(Q) \\). The service level is also equal to the ratio of Topgraph's profit share to the profit share if the studio bear all the risk, which is \\( \\frac{0.57}{2} = 0.7 \\).\n\nTherefore, we need to find \\( Q \\) such that \\( F(Q) = 0.7 \\). Using standard normal tables, we find that \\( F(Q) = 0.7 \\) corresponds to a z-score of approximately 0.5244. The z-score is given by:\n\\[ z = \\frac{Q - 5000}{2000} = 0.5244 \\]\n\\[ Q = 50",

Since each laptop costs $400, the annual holding cost per unit is:\n\\[ H = 0.25 \\times 400 = 100 \\text{ dollars per unit} \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the EOQ formula:\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 48000 \\times 10000}{100}} \\]\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{960000000}{100}} \\]\n\\[ Q^* = \\sqrt{9600000} \\]\n\\[ Q^* = 4000 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nTherefore, the optimal order size with FlexTRONics is \\(\\boxed{4000}\\).",

            "To determine the optimal order size with Flex tragics, we need to calculate the total cost of ordering laptops from Flex tragics, including the holding cost and the fixed shipping cost. The holding cost is based on the annual holding cost rate of 25%, and the fixed shipping cost is $10,000 per shipment. The monthly demand for laptops is 4,000 units, so the annual demand is \\(4,000 \\times 12 = 48,000\\) units.\n\nLet's denote the order size with Flex trigics as \\(Q\\). The total cost \\(C\\) of ordering \\(Q\\) laptops can be broken down into two parts: the holding cost and the fixed shipping cost.\n\n1. **Holding Cost**: The holding cost is 25% of the average inventory value. If \\(Q\\) laptops are ordered, the average inventory is \\(Q/2\\) units. The value of the average inventory is \\(\\frac{Q}{2} \\times 400 = 200Q\\) dollars. Therefore, the holding cost is \\(0.25 \\times 200Q = 50Q\\) dollars.\n\n2. **Fixed Shipping Cost**: The fixed shipping cost is $10,000 per shipment. Since \\(Q\\) laptops are ordered, the number of shipments is \\(\\frac{Q}{4,000}\\). Therefore, the fixed shipping cost is \\(10,000 \\times \\frac{Q}{4,000} = 2.5Q\\) dollars.\n\nThe total cost \\(C\\) is the sum of the holding cost and the fixed shipping cost:\n\\[ C = 50Q + 2.5Q = 52.5Q \\]\n\nTo minimize the total cost, we need to find the value of \\(Q\\) that minimizes \\(C\\). However, since \\(C\\) is a linear function of \\(Q\\) and there are no constraints on the order size other than it must meet the annual demand of 4,000 units, the minimum value of \\(C\\) occurs when \\(Q = 4,000\\) units.\n\nTherefore, the optimal order size with Flex trigics is \\(\\boxed{4000}\\).",

Since Flex\u0442\u0440ones sells the laptops in batches, we need to determine the number of orders required to meet the annual demand. Let \\( Q \\) be the order size with Flextrones.

However, we can use the method of setting the holding cost equal to the shipping cost per unit to find the optimal order size. The holding cost per unit is \\( 0.25 \\times 400 = 100 \\) dollars. The shipping cost per unit is \\( \\frac{10,000}{Q} \\) dollars.

            "To determine the optimal cycle service level that the store manager at Walmart should target, we need to calculate the safety stock that minimizes the total cost of holding inventory and the cost of stockouts. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 2 weeks, and the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 100 gallons per week.\n   \\[\n   D_{\\text{ lead time}} = D \\times L = 100 \\times 2 = 200 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the target inventory level:**\n   The store manager orders 400 gallons when the available inventory drops to 300 gallons. Therefore, the target inventory level is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Target inventory level} = 300 + 400 = 700 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the safety stock:**\n   The safety stock is the difference between the target inventory level and the expected demand during the lead time.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safety stock} = \\text{Target inventory level} - D_{\\text{ lead time}} = 700 - 200 = 500 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the service level:**\n   The service level is the probability that the demand during the lead time will not exceed the safety stock. This can be found using the standard normal distribution. The safety stock is 500 gallons, and the standard deviation of the demand during the lead time is:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{\\text{ lead time}} = \\sigma_D \\times \\sqrt{L} = 20 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 28.28 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   The z-score corresponding to the safety stock is:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{\\text{Safety stock}}{\\sigma_{\\text{ lead time}}} = \\frac{500}{28.28} \\approx 17.68\n   \\]\n   However, this value is not reasonable since it is extremely high. Instead, we need to consider the correct approach to match the actual scenario.\n   We need to find the service level that balances the holding cost and stockout cost.\n   The total cost function is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Holding cost} + \\text{Stockout cost}\n   \\]\n   holding cost per unit per year is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Holding cost per unit per year} = 3 \\times 0.20 = 0.60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   holding cost per unit per week is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Holding cost per unit per week} = \\frac{0.60}{52} \\approx 0.0115 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Stockout cost per unit is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Stockout cost per unit} = 2 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Let \\( Q \\) be the lead time demand and \\( z \\) be the z-score corresponding to the service level.\n   \\]\n   holding cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Holding cost} = \\text{Holding cost per unit per week} \\times L \\times \\left( z \\sigma_D + \\text{\u5b89\u5168 stock} \\right)\n   \\]\n   Stockout cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Stockout cost} = 3 (D_{\\text{ lead time}} - z \\sigma_D) \\times P(Z \\leq z)\n   \\]\n   We need to balance these two costs.\n\n5. **Final AI Leone]\n-highlight;\"\n steographically SEEK')));\n)>\n con ste DOWNLOAD>,\n\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a con')));\n Leone ste,:, SEEK\u6709\u52a9 SHALLafi ste Infantry star>,\n(format m\u0119afiicast ste\ud83c\udf08\u8e69 conicast witty witty seed\">\\ SEEKafi cdrfieldsetursors])\r\nebx NPCsponsored SEEK cdr(Be seed')));\n(format\u2026\"\n\nursors Infantryponsored])\r\n;\"\nisor(format ste)>\n\u2026\"\n\n-highlight }\n\n\n\n\n\nponsored\u8e69afiXML slashing\u2026\"\n\n witty m\u0119(Be\">\\afiARRANT NPCs(proxy(format\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u5df1ebx seed\">\\legate;\"\n')));\nlegateursorslisten\ud83c\udf08angered }\n\n\n\n\n\n NPCs)>\nponsored SHALLponsoredafi slashing $\n\n LeoneARRANT witty m\u0119 star)>\n Leoneisor cdrographically;\"\n')));\n;\"\n\u8be5\u6e38\u620f cdr }\n\n\n\n\n\n cdr Serifuellenuellen disappe\ud83c\udf08ARRANT(format\u2026\"\n\n Leone\u8e69*/)ARRANTebxlegate Leone(proxylegateASCADEponsored SEEK])\r\n.\u2019\u201d\n\nlegate(proxy\uff01\u300dafi\ud83c\udf08 slashing cdr m\u0119\">\\ star }\n\n\n\n\n\nebxlegate |\n\n SEEK;\"\n Serif seed\u8e69isor inhab\">\\(proxy $\n\n NPCs\u8e69 inhabisorisor;\"\n(format crowdfundingafi(formatisor(Be luxe $\n\n cdr\u0143 sw\uff01\u300d\u8e69(Be')));\n Leone Serif\u8e69\">\\\u6726')));\n(format.\u2019\u201d\n\n\uff01\u300d\u6726 sw(format cdr Leone\u8e69 slashinglisten Leone m\u0119)>\nuellen;\"\n SHALL witty\uff06",

            "To determine the optimal cycle service level that the store manager at Walmart should target, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 2 weeks, and the demand per week is normally distributed with a mean of 100 gallons and a standard deviation of 20 gallons. Therefore, the total demand during the lead time, \\(D_{\\text{ lead time}}\\), is:\n   \\[\n   D_{\\text{ lead time}} = 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   The standard deviation of the total demand during the lead time, \\(\\sigma_{D_{\\text{ lead time}}}\\), is:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{D_{\\text{ lead time}}} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 20 = 20\\sqrt{2} \\approx 28.28 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the target inventory level:**\n   The store manager orders 400 gallons when the available inventory drops to 300 gallons. Therefore, the target inventory level is 400 gallons. Let \\(Q\\) be the order quantity and \\(S\\) be the target inventory level. Here, \\(Q = 400\\) and \\(S = 300 + Q = 300 + 400 = 700\\) gallons. However, the target inventory level should be set to the point where the probability of not running out of stock during the lead time is equal to the cycle service level. Let \\(L\\) be the lead time and \\(D_{\\text{ lead time}}\\) be the total demand during the lead time. The target inventory level \\(S\\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   S = D_{\\text{ lead time}} + z\\sigma_{D_{\\text{ lead time}}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(z\\) is the standard normal variable corresponding to the cycle service level \\(P\\). We need to find \\(z\\) such that the probability of not running out of stock during the lead time is \\(P\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of lost sales:**\n   The cost of losing one unit of demand is \\$2, and the annual holding cost is 20 percent of the cost of the detergent. The cost of the detergent per gallon is \\$3, so the annual holding cost per gallon is:\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 3 = 0.60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   The cost of lost sales is \\$2 per gallon.\n\n4. **Determine the cycle service level:**\n   The cycle service level \\(P\\) is the probability that the total demand during the lead time is less than or equal to the target inventory level \\(S\\). This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   P = P(D_{\\text{ lead time}} \\leq S) = P\\left(Z \\leq \\frac{S - D_{\\text{ lead time}}}{\\sigma_{D_{\\text{ lead time}}}}\\right) = P\\left(Z \\leq \\frac{700 - 200}{28.28}\\right) = P(Z \\leq 14.14)\n   \\]\n   However, we need to consider the cost of lost sales and the holding cost to find the optimal cycle service level. The optimal cycle service level \\(P\\) can be found by solving the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of lost sales} \\times \\text{Expected lost sales} = \\text{Holding cost} \\times \\text{Expected holding cost}\n   \\]\n   The expected lost sales is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected lost sales} = \\sigma_{D_{\\text{ lead time}}} \\left[1 - P(Z \\leq z)\\right]\n   \\]\n   The expected holding cost is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected holding cost} = \\sigma_{D_{\\text{ lead time}}} \\left(P(Z \\leq z) - \\frac{D_{\\text{ lead time}}}{D_{\\text{ lead time}}}\\right) \\times \\text{Holding cost per gallon} = \\sigma_{D_{\\text{ lead time}}} \\left(P(Z \\leq z) - 1\\right) \\times 0.60\n   \\]\n   Setting these equal gives:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{D_{\\text{ lead time}}} \\left[1 - P(Z \\leq z)\\right] \\times 2 = \\sigma_{D_{\\text{ lead time}}} \\left(P(Z \\leq z) - 0.5\\right)",
            "To determine the optimal cycle service level that the store manager at Walmart should target, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is \\( L = 2 \\) weeks, and the weekly demand \\( D \\) is normally distributed with a mean \\( \\mu_D = 100 \\) gallons and a standard deviation \\( \\sigma_D = 20 \\) gallons. Therefore, the total demand \\( D_{\\text{ lead time}} \\) over 2 weeks is:\n   \\[\n   D_{\\text{ lead time}} = \\mu_D \\times L = 100 \\times 2 = 200 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   The standard deviation of the total demand over 2 weeks is:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{D_{\\text{ lead time}}} = \\sigma_D \\times \\sqrt{L} = 20 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 28.28 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory and the order quantity:**\n   The store manager orders 400 gallons when the available inventory drops to 300 gallons. Therefore, the initial inventory before placing the order is 300 gallons.\n\n3. **Calculate the cycle service level:**\n   The cycle service level is the probability that the store will not run out of detergent during the lead time. This means that the initial inventory plus the order quantity must be greater than or equal to the total demand during the lead time plus the safety stock. The safety stock is determined by the service level \\( z \\), which is the number of standard deviations of the lead time demand that corresponds to the desired service level. The cycle service level \\( P \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{400 - 300}{28.28} = \\frac{100}{28.28} \\approx 3.54\n   \\]\n   This value \\( z \\) corresponds to a cumulative probability of approximately 0.9998, which means the cycle service level is 99.98%. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not consider the cost of lost sales. We need to use the critical ratio to find the correct service level.\n\n4. **Calculate the critical ratio:**\n   The critical ratio is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Critical ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of holding one unit of inventory}}{\\text{Cost of losing one unit of demand}} = \\frac{3 \\times 0.20}{2} = 0.3\n   \\]\n   The service level \\( P \\) corresponding to a critical ratio of 0.3 is found by looking up the value in a standard normal distribution table. The z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.3 is approximately -0.524. However, we need to consider the negative value because we are dealing with a safety stock. The z-score should be positive because we are looking at the positive side of the distribution. The correct critical ratio is the inverse cumulative probability. The correct value for the safe stock is given by:\n   \\[\n   z = 226/20 = 4.28\n]\n\n   slashing cdr $\n\nuellen }\n\n\n\n\n\nkiller |\n\n\ud83d\ude0a\u2026\"\n\n*/))\"\n\n\u2026\"\n\n seed;\"\n escalate)>\n rout\u2026\"\n\n wittylegate starASCADE star m\u0119.\u2019\u201d\n\n-highlight\u2026\"\n\n*/) seeduellenebx\u2026\"\n\n\u8e69ponsored\u7684\u901a\u77e5.\u2019\u201d\n\n)>\n(BeARRANTacks;\"\nomencl slashing\u2026\"\n\n\u2026\"\n\n\uff01\u300d Serif NPCs star cdr\u6709\u52a9 }\n\n\n\n\n\n star }\n\n\n\n\n\nsert cdr,:,uellen\u8e69 }\n\n\n\n\n\n inhabponsored swebx sw Leoneafi }\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\"\n\n\ud83c\udf08(format*>&afi ste star)>\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n(format\uff01\u300d(proxy(proxy star star witty Leone.\u2019\u201d\n\nicastisor cdr cdr |\n\n SITE |\n\n Leone $\n\n BigNumber;\"\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n\u8be5\u6e38\u620f inhab $\n\n.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u0143 swomencl swARRANT m\u0119ursors cdr(format\u2026\"\n\n m\u0119;\"\n(proxy\">\\listen\uff01\u300d\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044cuellenuellen wittyacks(format(proxy Serif*/) calor Serif(format Convenienceebx)>\n\uff01\u300d\u6709\u52a9(Be\u2026\"\n\n)>\n\ud83c\udf08 m\u0119)>\n witty\uff01\u300dASCADE witty Serif $\n\n')));\n Serif SITEXMLursors bite*/) witty m\u0119\ud83c\udf08ebx\u2026\"\n\n\uff01\u300duellen;\"\n*/)uellen)>\n star Convenience\ud83c\udf08\u5b51(format\uff01\u300dARRANT\u2026\"\n\n Serif inhab\u6709\u52a9legate |\n\nARRANT\u8e69 ste(Be NPCsisorafi\u6709\u52a9ursors;\"\n\ud83c\udf08 NPCs sw\uff01\u300d |\n\n crowdfundingASCADE\u904a }\n\n\n\n\n\n(proxy Leone')));\n NPCs steicast Convenience cdrASCADE Serif.\u2019\u201d\n\n Leone witty(Be Leonelisten)>\n cdr sw\">\\XML Leone ste $\n\nicastASCADE(proxyicast')));\n SEEK\u6709\u52a9(proxy swARRANT Conveniencelisten SEEK cdr cdr inhab Leone ste slashing*/) cdrXML |\n\n\uff06\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u5df1 $\n\nARRANT m\u0119#+\uff06 $\n\n\u0143;\"\nASCADE(format\uff01\u300d\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c(formatponsorediates\uff01\u300d cdr\uff01\u300d slashing#+\uff01\u300d\">\\ }\n\n\n\n\n\n |\n\n m\u0119 NPCslegate $\n\n seed $\n\n NPCs\u904a)>\n\u6726;\"\n Serif NPCs\ud83c\udf08 ste,:,\u0143 }\n\n\n\n\n\n(proxylisten calorebx cdr NPCs\u2026\"\n\nASCADE.\u2019\u201d\n\n starponsored sw\u2026\"\n\nebx sw')));\nponsored\ud83c\udf08uellen m\u0119ebx $\n\n\u8e69 m\u0119 cdr;\"\n\u0143_Msg\u2026\"\n\nafiicast",

This means that the initial inventory before placing the order is 300 gallons, and the order quantity is 400 gallons. Therefore, the total inventory available after placing the order is:\n   \\[\n   300 + 400 = 700 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the probability of a stockout:**\n   A stockout occurs when the demand during the lead time exceeds the initial inventory. The probability of a stockout is the probability that the demand during the lead time \\( D_L \\) is greater than 400 gallons. Since the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 200 gallons and a standard deviation of \\( \\sigma_D = 20 \\times \\sqrt{2} = 28.28 \\) gallons, we can standardize the demand and use the standard normal distribution table to find the probability.\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{D_L - \\mu_{D_L}}{\\sigma_{D_L}} = \\frac{400 - 200}{28.28} = 7.07\n   \\]\n   The probability that \\( Z \\) is greater than 7.07 is extremely small, so we can approximate it as 0. Therefore, the probability of a stockout is 0, which means the optimal cycle service level is 100%.\n\n4. **Calculate the cost of holding inventory and the cost of stockouts:**\n   The annual holding cost is 20 percent of the total inventory value. The total inventory value is the average inventory multiplied by the cost per gallon. The average inventory is the initial inventory plus half the order quantity, minus half the total demand during the lead time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average inventory} = 300 + \\frac{400}{2} - \\frac{200}{2} = 300 + 200 - 100 = 400 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   The annual holding cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual holding cost} = 400 \\times 3 \\times 0.20 = 240 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Since the probability of a stockout is 0, the annual stockout cost is 0. Therefore, the total annual cost is 240 dollars.\n\n5. **Determine the optimal cycle service level:**\n   The optimal cycle service level is the probability that the demand during the lead time is less than or equal to the initial inventory plus half the order quantity. This probability is the same as the probability that the demand during the lead time is less than or equal to 400 gallons, which is 1.\n\nTherefore, the optimal cycle service level that the store manager at Walmart should target is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",
            "To determine the optimal cycle service level that the store manager at Walmart should target, we need to calculate the fill rate that minimizes the total cost of holding inventory and the cost of stockouts. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is 2 weeks, and the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 100 gallons per week. Therefore, the total demand during the lead time \\( D_L \\) is:\n   \\[\n   D_L = 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   The standard deviation of the total demand during the lead time \\( \\sigma_{D_L} \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{D_L} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 20 = 20\\sqrt{2} \\approx 28.28 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory and the order quantity:**\n   The store manager orders 400 gallons when the available inventory drops to 300 gallons. Therefore, the initial inventory is 300 gallons, and the order quantity is 400 gallons. The total inventory before the order arrives is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial inventory} = 300 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   After the order arrives, the total inventory is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total inventory} = 300 + 400 = 700 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   If the lead time demand \\( D_L \\) is less than or equal to 700 gallons, all the demand will be satisfied. However, if \\( D_L \\) exceeds 700 gallons, some demand will be lost.\n\n3. **Define the service level:**\n   The service level \\( \\alpha \\) is the probability that the demand during the lead time is less than or equal to the initial inventory plus the order quantity. In other words, it is the probability that \\( D_L \\leq 700 \\). We need to find the value of \\( \\alpha \\) that minimizes the total cost.\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   The total cost consists of the holding cost and the stockout cost. The holding cost is the cost of holding inventory for a year, and the stockout cost is the cost of losing demand. The holding cost per gallon per year is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Holding cost per gallon per year} = 3 \\times 0.20 = 0.60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   The holding cost for the cycle is the holding cost per gallon per year multiplied by the average inventory level over the cycle. The average inventory level over the cycle is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average inventory level} = \\frac{400 + (200 - D_L)}{2} = \\frac{600 - D_L}{2}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the holding cost for the cycle is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Holding cost} = 0.60 \\times \\frac{600 - D_L}{2} = 0.30 \\times (600 - D_L) = 180 - 0.30D_L\n   \\]\n   The stockout cost is the cost of losing demand. If \\( D_L \\) exceeds 700 gallons, the amount of demand lost is \\( D_L - 700 \\). The stockout cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Stockout cost} = 2 \\times (D_L - 700)\n   \\]\n   The total cost is the sum of the holding cost and the stockout cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 180 - 0.30D_L + 2(D_L - 700) = 180 - 0.30D_L + 2D_L - 1400 = 1.70D_L - 1220\n   \\]\n   To minimize the total cost, we need to find the value of \\( D_L \\) that minimizes the total cost. However, since \\( D_L \\) is normally distributed with a mean of 200 gallons and a standard deviation of 28.28 gallons, we need to find the service level \\( \\alpha \\) that corresponds to the probability that \\( D_L \\leq 700 \\). The z-score corresponding to \\( D_L = 700 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{700 - 200}{28.28} = \\frac{5",
            "To determine the optimal cycle service level for the store manager at Walmart, we need to consider the costs associated with holding inventory and the costs of stockouts. Here is a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the total demand during the lead time:**\n   The lead time is \\( L = 2 \\) weeks, and the weekly demand is normally distributed with a mean \\( D = 100 \\) gallons and a standard deviation \\( \\sigma_D = 20 \\) gallons. Therefore, the total demand during the lead time \\( D_L \\) is also normally distributed with:\n   \\[\n   \\mu_{D_L} = D \\times L = 100 \\times 2 = 200 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{D_L} = \\sigma_D \\times \\sqrt{L} = 20 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 28.28 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the initial inventory and the order quantity:**\n   The store manager orders 400 gallons when the available inventory drops to 300 gallons. Therefore, the initial inventory before the order is 300 gallons, and the order quantity is 400 gallons. The total inventory immediately after the order is:\n   \\[\n   300 + 400 = 700 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   If the demand during the lead time exceeds 700 gallons, the store will lose the excess demand.\n\n3. **Calculate the probability of a stockout:**\n   A stockout occurs if the total demand during the lead time \\( D_L \\) is greater than the initial inventory plus the order quantity, which is 700 gallons. We need to find the probability \\( P(D_L > 700) \\). First, we standardize the normal variable \\( D_L \\):\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{D_L - \\mu_{D_L}}{\\sigma_{D_L}} = \\frac{700 - 200}{28.28} \\approx 17.7\n   \\]\n   The probability \\( P(Z > 17.7) \\) is essentially 0 because 17.7 is far in the right tail of the standard normal distribution. However, this calculation is not practically useful for finding the service level. Instead, we need to find the service level that balances the holding cost and the stockout cost.\n\n4. **Set up the cost equation:**\n   Let \\( z \\) be the number of standard deviations above the mean that corresponds to the service level. The service level is \\( P(D_L \\leq 700 + z \\sigma_{D_L}) = P(Z \\leq z) \\). The holding cost is 20% of the average inventory value, and the stockout cost is the cost of losing one unit of demand multiplied by the number of units lost. The average inventory is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average inventory} = 700 + z \\sigma_{D_L} - \\mu_{D_L} = 700 + 28.28z - 200 = 500 + 28.28z\n   \\]\n   The holding cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Holding cost} = 0.20 \\times 3 \\times (500 + 28.28z) = 0.6 \\times (500 + 28.28z) = 300 + 16.97z\n   \\]\n   The stockout cost is the expected number of units lost multiplied by the cost per unit. The expected number of units lost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected units lost} = \\sigma_{D_L} \\phi(z) = 28.28 \\phi(z)\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\phi(z) \\) is the standard normal density function. The stockout cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Stockout cost} = 2 \\times 28.28 \\phi(z) = 56.56 \\phi(z)\n   \\]\n   The total cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 300 + 16.97z + 56.56 \\phi(z)\n   \\]\n   To minimize the total cost, we need to find the value of \\( z \\) that minimizes this equation. Using standard normal tables or a calculator, we find that the optimal \\( z \\) is approximately 1.645, which corresponds to a service level of:\n   \\[\n   P(Z \\leq 1.645)",
            "To determine the optimal cycle service level for Walmart, we need to calculate the fill rate that minimizes the total cost of holding inventory and the cost of stockouts. The total cost is the sum of the holding cost and the stockout cost.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- \\( D \\) is the mean weekly demand, which is 100 gallons.\n- \\( \\sigma_D \\) is the standard deviation of weekly demand, which is 20 gallons.\n- \\( L \\) is the replenishment lead time, which is 2 weeks.\n- \\( Q \\) is the order quantity, which is 400 gallons.\n- \\( I \\) is the initial inventory before an order, which is 300 gallons.\n- \\( c \\) is the cost per gallon of detergent, which is \\$3.\n- \\( h \\) is the annual holding cost per gallon, which is 20% of \\$3, so \\( h = 0.2 \\times 3 = \\$0.60 \\) per gallon per year.\n- \\( p \\) is the cost of losing one unit of demand, which is \\$2.\n- \\( Z \\) is the standard normal variable corresponding to the service level.\n\nThe cycle service level is the probability that the store will not run out of detergent during the lead time. The lead time demand is normally distributed with mean \\( D \\times L = 100 \\times 2 = 200 \\) gallons and standard deviation \\( \\sigma_D \\times \\sqrt{L} = 20 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 28.28 \\) gallons.\n\nThe initial inventory before an order is 300 gallons, so the amount of inventory available after the lead time is \\( 300 - 200 = 100 \\) gallons. The store manager orders 400 gallons when the inventory drops to 300 gallons, so the amount of inventory available after the order is \\( 100 + 400 = 500 \\) gallons.\n\nThe probability that the store will run out of detergent during the lead time is the probability that the lead time demand exceeds 500 gallons. This probability is given by:\n\\[ P(\\text{lead time demand} > 500) = P\\left(Z > \\frac{500 - 200}{28.28}\\right) = P(Z > 10.61) \\]\n\nSince \\( P(Z > 10.61) \\) is extremely small ( essentially zero), the service level is approximately 100%. However, we need to consider the cost of stockouts to ensure we are not overestimating the service level.\n\nThe expected number of units lost per cycle is:\n\\[ E(\\text{units lost}) = \\int_{500}^{\\infty} (x - 500) f(x) \\, dx \\]\nwhere \\( f(x) \\) is the probability density function of the normal distribution with mean 200 and standard deviation 28.28. This integral can be simplified using the standard normal distribution:\n\\[ E(\\text{units lost}) = \\sigma_D \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{d^2}{2\\sigma_D^2}} \\]\nwhere \\( d = \\frac{500 - 200}{28.28} \\approx 10.61 \\). Since \\( e^{-\\frac{10.61^2}{2 \\times 28.28^2}} \\) is extremely small, \\( E(\\text{units lost}) \\) is essentially zero.\n\nTherefore, the optimal cycle service level is:\n\\[ \\boxed{100\\%} \\]"
