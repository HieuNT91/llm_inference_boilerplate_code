            "To determine the optimal price of DO to a manufacturer discount of $0.15 per unit, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the demand curve and the price paid by the retailer after the discount:**\n   The demand curve is given by \\( Q = 300,000 - 60,000p \\). Let \\( p_r \\) be the price paid by the retailer after the discount. Since the manufacturer offers a discount of $0.15 per unit, we have \\( p_r = p - 0.15 \\). Substituting \\( p_r \\) into the demand curve, we get:\n   \\[\n   Q = 300,000 - 60,000(p - 0.15) = 300,000 - 60,000p + 9,000 = 309,000 - 60,000p\n   \\]\n\n2. **Express the manufacturer's revenue as a function of the price \\( p \\):**\n   The manufacturer's revenue \\( R \\) is the product of the price paid by the retailer and the quantity sold, so:\n   \\[\n   R = p \\cdot Q = p \\cdot (309,000 - 60,000p) = 309,000p - 60,000p^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the price that maximizes the manufacturer's revenue:**\n   To maximize the revenue, we take the derivative of \\( R \\) with respect to \\( p \\) and set it to zero:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dR}{dp} = 309,000 - 120,000p = 0\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( p \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   120,000p = 309,000 \\implies p = \\frac{309,000}{120,000} = 2.575\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify that this price maximizes the revenue:**\n   To confirm that this price maximizes the revenue, we check the second derivative of \\( R \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2R}{dp^2} = -120,000\n   \\]\n   Since the second derivative is negative, the function \\( R \\) has a maximum at \\( p = 2.575 \\).\n\nTherefore, the optimal price of DO to a manufacturer discount of $0.15 per unit is \\(\\boxed{2.575}\\).",

Therefore, the effective cost per bottle for the retailer is:\n   \\[\n   C_R' = 3 - 0.15 = 2.85\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total revenue (TR) function for the retailer:**\n\n   Total revenue is given by the product of the price per bottle and the quantity demanded:\n   \\[\n   TR = p \\cdot Q\n   \\]\n\n   Substitute \\( Q \\) from the demand curve into the TR function:\n   \\[\n   TR = p \\cdot (300,000 - 60,000p)\n   \\]\n   Simplify the expression:\n   \\[\n   TR = 300,000p - 60,000p^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the profit function for the retailer:**\n\n   Profit is given by the total revenue minus the total cost. The total cost for the retailer is:\n   \\[\n   TC = C_R' \\cdot Q = 2.85 \\cdot (300,000 - 60,000p)\n   \\]\n   Simplify the expression:\n   \\[\n   TC = 2.85 \\cdot 300,000 - 2.85 \\cdot 60,000p\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   TC = 855,000 - 171,000p\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the profit function for the retailer is:\n   \\[\n   \\pi = TR - TC = (300,000p - 60,000p^2) - (855,000 - 171,000p)\n   \\]\n   Simplify the expression:\n   \\[\n   \\pi = 300,000p - 60,000p^2 - 855,000 + 171,000p\n   \\]\n   Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   \\pi = -60,000p^2 + 471,000p - 855,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the price that maximizes the retailer's profit:**\n\n   To maximize profit, we take the derivative of the profit function with respect to \\( p \\) and set it to zero:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\pi}{dp} = -120,000p + 471,000\n   \\]\n   Set the derivative equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   -120,000p + 471,000 = 0\n   \\]\n   Solve for \\( p \\):\n   \\[\n   120,000p = 471,000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{471,000}{120,000}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   p = 3.925\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the optimal price for DO:**\n\n   Since \\( p = 3.925 \\) is the price the retailer pays after the discount, the original price charged by DO to the retailer (before the discount) is:\n   \\[\n   P = p + 0.15 = 3.925 + 0.15 = 4.075\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the optimal price for DO to charge is \\(\\boxed{4.075}\\)."
